### STORMREACH – Crown of the Skilathos

> *“There lies Stormreach—stone-browed and salt-blooded—where treaties are inked in wine and watched by the ghosts of gods.”*

*From a distance, it gleams: a city carved from cliffs and crowned in marble, its terraces stepping down to harbors bristling with sails, galleys, and shimmering sky-docks. Great circular monuments hang in the air, relics of an age when gods walked the earth and mortals carved their names into the bones of history.*

*This is Stormreach, first bastion of Ellesion, final outpost before the Skilathos opens like a blade. It has stood through empire and collapse, godswar and peace. Here, kings made pacts with disguised divinities, and here, centuries later, their descendants still meet beneath open-air colonnades to argue over salt, trade, and war.*

*It is not a city of temples. It is a city of memory. Of myths that were once morning news, and architecture that outlived its patrons. People say the past walks freely in Stormreach—not as ghosts, but as precedent.*

> *“You don’t step into Stormreach,” an old dockhand once said.*  
> *“You step into a story that hasn’t finished being told.”*

Stormreach is a coastal city perched on the northeastern tip of the continent of [[Eos/Ellesion/Ellesion\|Ellesion]], bordered by the Starfallen Sea to the east and a narrow strait to the north that leads into [[Eos/Ellesion/The Skilathos Sea\|The Skilathos Sea]]. A nexus of diplomacy, naval might, and mythic memory, Stormreach is a cultural and strategic keystone for all who travel the northern seas or seek passage into the Skilathos.

- **Gateway to the Skilathos Sea** – Entry point into a region with millennia of trade, war, and divine lore
- **Strategic Outpost** – Critical in times of war; a hub of diplomacy and trade in times of peace.
- **Diplomatic Anchor** – Politically tied to the powerful city-state of [[Eos/Ellesion/Altrinios\|Altrinios]], about 400 miles to the south.

#### Historical Context
- **Skilaic Period (2300–2000 years ago)** – Following the Raven Queen's ascension, the gods walked the world in mortal form, seducing, warring, and reshaping history.
- **Godswar** – Culmination of divine conflict. Ended with the creation of the Divine Gate.
- **Modern Stormreach** – A city shaped by its myths but governed by mortals. The gods are gone, but their shadows remain in stone and sea.

#### Aesthetic & Architecture

- **Floating Islands** – Remnants of the Age of Upheaval hover in the sky, connected to towers or used as airship docks.

- **Tideforged Guild** – Influential shipwrights and weatherwrights controlling economic flow.
- **Order of the Silver Wake** – Religious keepers of storm-lore, bound to the Raven Queen’s legacy.
- **The Cindercircle** – A secretive group advocating the return of divine presence and the fall of the Divine Gate.

#### Cultural Atmosphere
- **Stone remembers gods, and the sea never forgets.**
- Myth and diplomacy coexist. History is not past, but precedent.
- Civic architecture is designed for storytelling, ceremony, and record-keeping.

### Taverns of Tide’s Rest

**The Bitter Peel**  
Cozy, dim, and citrus-scented. Frequented by retired spies and informants. Known for orange-spiced rum and secretive conversations.

**The Broken Keel**  
Rough and smoky; the brawling tavern of mercs, sailors, and skyship crews. Has a brawling pit called "The Wet Deck."

**Flood & Flame**  
Elegant yet worn. Frequented by naval officers and diplomats. Stained glass depicts the Godswar. Duels happen quietly in back rooms.

**The Drifting Bell**  
Floating tavern tethered to the quay. Haunting, romantic, and prophetic. Its bell rings with the tide—or sometimes when no tide moves at all.

**The Eel’s Knot**  
Half-tavern, half-gambling den built into a dry-docked ship. Smugglers and pirates gather here. Possible underground passages.

### The Crimson Wake Uprising

**67 years ago**, a Starfallen Sea pirate coalition under the warlord **Captain Veil** launched coordinated strikes on trade routes, citing ancient sea-rights and lost myths. The conflict lasted three years, using storm magic and ambush tactics. Rumors of Cindercircle involvement persist. It ended when Veil’s flagship vanished during a blood eclipse.
