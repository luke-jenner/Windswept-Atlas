## City of Storm-Iron, in the Stormvault Mountains

- Nestled in the Stormvault Mountains of Southeastern [[Eos/Kawluurac/Kawluurac\|Kawluurac]], where violent electrical storms form due to arcane pressures from sea breezes meeting high peaks
- Continuous storms roll through with regular sky-splitting lightning
- Natural phenomena like "sky rivers" - slow-floating arcs of electrical discharge - have been seen as divine traces of Kord, the Storm Lord
- Across [[Eos/Ellesion/The Skilathos Sea\|The Skilathos Sea]] from [[Eos/Ellesion/Stormreach\|Stormreach]], with shipping lanes protected by storm-hewn harpoons - automated, lightning-charged coastal defenses 

## Cultural Identity

- For millenia, has held Kord the Storm Lord as its patron
	- Worship is built into civid life: storm prediction, electrical conductors, and lightning forges are all considered sacred rites
- Philosophy of Strength: Storms are not seen as curses, but as gifts that challenge mortals to rise
- Personal strength, innovation, and resilience are divine virtues 

- **Stormcall Nights**: Once per tenday, lightning dances over the city in a predictable rhythm - all forgework stops to make offerings to Kord
- **The Fulminari Choir** - Choir of storm-touched bards who sing with lightning-infused voices
- **The Scorched Anvil**: A massive floating anvil tethered above the city, struc, by lightning daily to bless all creations forged below

## History
- First Age
	- Local mountain tribes (early dwarves and storm elves) worshipped storm deities
	- Some say Kord *walked* the mountaintops, striking the first vein of Thunderbolt Iron
- Godswar
	- Site of the Stormwake Rebellion - mortals channeling lightning to battle divine avatars
	- Cataclysmic storms reshaped the coast
	- Sunken battlefield called The Fulminant Tomb lies in wreckage on the coast, still crackling with divine echoes
- Age of Demons (2nd age, 1300-1450 BR)
	- Demonic incursion attempted to infect the stormfields; one storm-giant archdemon was sealed beneath Ael'Kradon Crater by dwarven heroes wielding storm-forged scepters 
	- Cults of Talos flourished and were violently purged in a war called The Tempest Reclamation - remnants still survive in the Undermines
