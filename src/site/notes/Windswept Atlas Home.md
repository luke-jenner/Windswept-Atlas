## The Realms of Eos
As a whole, the world is in its ‘Third Age.’ With centuries of history, a popular fable of numerous now-ancient religions indicate a pantheon of higher gods that created Eos, though those gods allegedly abandoned the world after Humankind and Elves advanced technologically, began exploring the world, and in an effort of empiricism waged war upon one another. Neither side won the war as it was ended by the gods leaving the Physical Plane for the Ethereal Plane, leaving both races to their own civilizations on separate continents and ending the First Age.

The Second Age saw the rise of trans-continental trade, capital-barter system with Gold, and major developments in building through the Dwarves across Eos. Human invaders to Sylith, with more developed technology, began offering work to Sylithians overseas starting a network of indentured servitude which, left unchecked and unregulated, turned to slavery on the Willowan continent.

Developing Sylithian governments began to demand the release of their indentured people in Willow and political tensions rose. A series of assassinations in both Kingdoms started a war overseas. The war turned into a battle of attrition, eventually the Willowan Kingdom emancipating all Sylith in a treaty and letting them return home, though leaving bitter resentment between races.

The Third Age, in the wake of the Sylithian War, saw dramatic revolutions to the industrial use of Ether and Ethereal technology spread throughout Willow, along with the industries of mining, refining, and selling it.
