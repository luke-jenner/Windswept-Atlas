## A History of Eos
(Start of Campaign 2 - Tarsahk, 2023 B.R.)
### The First Age

Eos - the Known World - is in its Third Age. With millenia of history, popular legends and fables of the numerous faiths indicate that at the beginning of the First Age, a pantheon of higher gods defeated the tyrannical primordials that came before them and brought freedom to mortals across the Prime Material Plane. For millenia, the [[World Lore/Gods\|gods]] saw over the mortals, though as the various species developed cities and technologies of their own, gods eventually spent less time in the material plane and more time in their divine domains. Now independent, the mortal species began harnessing magical capabilities bestowed by the Ethereal Weave.

In time, through arcane powers the races built floating city-states, of which rose various empires - alliances of nigh-invincible nations of magic and wonders, dominating the ground-continents across the Starred Sea. As the hubris of the arcane cities expanded, as did their hostility and strife with one another - each in an arms race, attempting to usurp the roles of the gods. Arcane Wars began, as did the struggles of divinity, ushering in a time of chaos. Inevitably, the incited disruption sent the flying cities crashing to the ground bringing an end to great empires. In the aftermath, diaspora and feudal wars ensued across the now-Starfallen Sea.

In the centuries following the Fall of Flying Cities, many ground settlements of the Southern Heartlands (now-[[Eos/Willow/Willow\|willow]]), the Wild West (now-[[Eos/Kawluurac/Kawluurac\|Kawluurac]] & [[Eos/Ellesion/Ellesion\|Ellesion]]), and the Northern Holds (now-[[Eos/Dar'Rag\|Dar'Rag]]) took in refugees from the fallen empires, and new settlmeents made up primarily of survivors and their descendents were established. 

The end of the First Age is marked by [[World Lore/The Godswar\|The Godswar]] - also known as the Time of Troubles, the Arrival, and the Avatar Crisis - struck the mortal species as a rapid cataclysm. Through uncertain causes, the deities of Eos were forced to walk the earth in their mortal avatar forms. In seeking to recover their divinity and in disagreement on their purpose, the gods warred amongst themselves. Magic became unpredictable and the prayers of the faithful went unanswered. Several major deities died during the Time of Troubles and a handful of mortals rose to divinity, assuming the responsibilities of dead deities. 

Many mortals rose to the call of [[World Lore/The Godswar\|the Godswar]], organizing under religious factions. Battlefields of catastrophic showdowns of [[World Lore/The Godswar\|the Godswar]] are scattered across Eos, wounds in the landscape lasting for eons. Little record remains of the terrible war, nor is there clear resolution of the victors. Its end was marked by the disappearance of the gods - the faithful believing they passed through a Divine Gate to establish peace, the faithless believing the gods dead or still among the mortals. 

### The Second Age

The Second Age saw the rise of transcontinental trade and major developments in building through ether-smiths across Eos, and with it, the rise of new powers. In the Heartlands, the infant Willowan Kingdom made its capital home on the west coast of the continent. During a period known as **<font color="#00b0f0">The Crown Wars</font>**, nations across the Heartlands broke out in feudalism, rallying behind heritage claims of the Fallen Cities, holy lands of gods, or manifest destiny. The conflicted lands of [[Eos/Kawluurac/Kawluurac\|Kawluurac]] saw the rise and fall of many kingdoms, governments, provinces, and dynasties, as well as a prevalence of arcane intervention with the fragmented divinity. Many cults rose and began to feud, ushering in a time referred to as the [[World Lore/Age of Demons\|Age of Demons]]; a catastrophic war across the Prime Material Plane that extended the Blood War between the Hells and the Abyss. With the spread of dormant evils and powers of [[World Lore/The Godswar\|The Godswar]], [[Eos/Ellesion/Ellesion\|Ellesion]] too fell victim to large scale catastrophes such as the [[Rage of Dragons\|Rage of Dragons]]. To combat growing evils, bands of heroes and armies of the kingdoms gradually put aside their wars and grew tentative alliance, beginning an age of exploration, expedition, as well as archeology. 

As conquests and kingdoms grew, dominant powers made took their holds across the continents. In [[Eos/Kawluurac/Kawluurac\|Kawluurac]], the [[Eos/Kawluurac/Thay\|Thay]]an Frontier grew mighty in the wake of the Age of Demons, high upon their unnatural plateaus. In [[Eos/Dar'Rag\|Dar'Rag]], the dwarfholds began to close their gates to most transcontinental commerce. In the Heartlands, as kingdoms grew weary of the powers across the Starfallen Sea, alliances were formed and the [[Eos/Willow/Willow\|Willow]]an Kingdom established dominion over the continent through treaties with other nation-states and the continent came to be known as  [[Eos/Willow/Willow (Continent)\|Willow (Continent)]].

[[Eos/Willow/Willow\|Willow]]an and [[Eos/Ellesion/Ellesion\|Ellesion]] conquerors made their way across the Starfallen Sea to [[Eos/Kawluurac/Kawluurac\|Kawluurac]] and its mountains and jungles, rich with natural resources. Sylithians across their jungle-nation of Ssarlona, at this time, were rebuilding from the [[World Lore/Age of Demons\|Age of Demons]]. THe Willowan invaders, with more developed ethereal technology, began offering work to Sylithians overseas. This culture of colonialist supremacy started a network of indentured servitude which, left unchecked and unregulated, turned to slavery on the Willowan continent. 

Developing Ssarlonian governments began to demand the release of their people in Willow and political tensions rose. A series of assassinations in both kingdoms started a war overseas. The war turned into a battle of attrition, eventually the Willowan Kingdom emancipating all Slythians in a treaty and letting them return home, though leaving bitter resentment between the kingdoms. 
### The Third Age

In the wake of the Ssarlona-Willow war, The Third Age has seen dramatic revolutions to hte industrial use of Ether and Ethereal technology spread throughout Eos, along with the industries of mining, refining, and selling ethereal ore. 

On Willow, [[Factions/Magaron\|Magaron]] Corporation emerged, through the sanctioning of Willowan arcanists, and jump-started the drive to develop civilization. Over the recent century and a half, many outer-settlements across [[Eos/Willow/Willow\|Willow]] began to polarize towards city centers as Magaron [[built\|built]] ethereal reactors that would harness ether from the earth and distribute it throughout the cities. Many were left uncomfortable by the culture of accelerationism, believing the industrial use of ether to be a marring an da blight to the natural or divine order and a threat to the environmental stability of Eos. Resistance groups emerged, launching guerilla eco-terrorist strikes against [[Factions/Magaron\|Magaron]], further destablizing the ethereal weave in the regions. During a year known as the [[Crisis of Dragons\|Crisis of Dragons]], and subsequently the Breaking of Willow, the reactors were destroyed, with Willowan officials mandating their deconstruction and cleanup as the Willowan Kingdom was left fractured into smaller kingdoms, provinces, and free cities. 

In [[Eos/Kawluurac/Kawluurac\|Kawluurac]], the [[Eos/Kawluurac/Thay\|Thay]]an Plateau has seen a literal geographic expansion through magical means - heightening its escaprments while pushing out into the Ssarlonian Jungles. Fear grows that Thayan leader Szass Tam is seeking to extend his dominion and may be on the brink of military action or otherwise. With no clear political force powerful enough to stop them on [[Eos/Kawluurac/Kawluurac\|Kawluurac]] after the War with Willow weakened Ssarlona, anxiety grows across the continent. 

[[Eos/Ellesion/Ellesion\|Ellesion]] has become a bastion of academic pursuits and technological innovations. More complex understandings of Ether, the Weave, and natural materials across Eos have been harnessed, resulting in the rise of skyward travel as well as flying settlements, echoing the ancient histories. While the cities of [[Eos/Ellesion/Ellesion\|Ellesion]] fill with a complicating arcane industrial age, the Ellesion Seas and Fileds grow even more populated with wildlife - primal cultures, magical creatures, and fantastical wonders are alive like never before. With these urges of power has come instability - devotees of the divine face the perils of a culture that is leaving behind its faiths, grassroot factions and guilds embolden themselves to upset and imbalance political structures, and ancient lore and magicks that were once hidden are now being rediscovered. 

### Underdark 

Extending miles downward and outward beneath the surface of Willow and reaching to other continents as well, the great network of subterranean caverns known as the Underdark is home to all manner of strange and deadly creatures. Duergar and drow - dark reflections of dwarves and elves - live in the sunless lands, as do svirfneblin, or deep gnomes. Most surface-dwelling folk aren’t threatened or even disturbed by denizens of the deep places, but the creatures occasionally emerge to raid or to seek some kind of goal in the surface world.

Among the lands of the Underdark beneath Willow are the svirfneblin city of Blingdenstone (under [[Eos/Willow/Pthalo Realm\|Pthalo Realm]]), the duergar city of Gracklstugh (under Pthal’Baen-[[Eos/Willow/Pthaleon\|Pthaleon]]), and the imfamous drow city of Menzoberranzan (under the Ethelrim). Also prominent is Mantol-Derith (under Zandrost), a trading post for underdark merchants.
