The Dreamless Matron

- 'Mother' to [[Glint\|Glint]]
- Lives in a walled grove in  [[The Feywild\|The Feywild]]
- Collects memories and dreams

### Appearance
Appearance is both mesmerizing and unsettling
	- Face that resembles a beautiful, warm grandmother - though seems to textend past her head as if it were a mask that she wears that animates *just slightly* out of sync with her words, though is adorned with a smile that splits its features in half
	- Her eyes - clearly eyes - are rimmed with an eye shadow that glows like purple embers, winging out to a beautiful charcoal - the eyes themselves are almost like purple cinders, silently crackling in the light
	- Draped in robes of shifting colors and patterns that obscure the outline of her body, animating across her robes are strange sigils that pulse and intermittently warp the very air around her
	- Her form - tall, maybe 6 feet with a bit of a lean, appears human, though moves like a gentle breeze is blowing through her bones like branches - 
	- maybe that feeling is given off by the literal vines that come out from under her robes around her shoulders, like a mantle made of ivy
	- Despite her unsettling appearance, there is an undeinable allure to her - she doesn't appear threatening - like that person from across the bar that you feel like you could talk to and already have a familial understanding with
