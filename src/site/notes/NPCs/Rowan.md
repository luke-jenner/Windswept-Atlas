#### Rowan - Firbolg [[Factions/Horizon Guard\|Horizon Guard]], Palace of Exile
imposing height of 6'8" firbolg, long, wavy white hair that drops down below their waistline almost like a cape, pink-beige skin that is mostly hidden by a deep navy coat of fur and what looks like enchanted armor crafted from interwoven leaves of plate, etched with arcane symbols. Beneath the armor sits a waist cape of deep violets with silver lining, like an extension of their hair. Carries two sheathed weapons. 

- Captain of [[Factions/Horizon Guard\|Horizon Guard]]
