Satyr - coat of black fur that shimmers in the astral light of Halios, complimented by pale skin - expressive, hazel eyes beneath a very asymmetrical haircut - buzzed sides, lopsided hanging bangs with what would be a mullet currently tied back into a messy bun

Dressed in a very baggy, black tunic with small white symbols embroidered into it - strapped to his back is a handcrafted lyre.

Multi-talented artist, excels in celestial landscapes, improvised music, and poetry. 

Regularly hosts poetry readings & storytelling as entertainment at the **Sojurn**. Currently bartending there as an in-between job, figuring out what comes next. 

Often sought after for ethereal commissions, enchantements, and Dreamweaver Murals - depict scenes from an indvidiual's dreams. 

Stardust sculptures, collected from ethereal winds of the Eternal Comet - very ephemeral 

Organizes "moonlit soirees" - fusion of art, music, and dance for visitors of the ethereal plane
