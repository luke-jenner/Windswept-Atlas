Wylydia (vil-id-ee-uh)- a human woman, older, seeming to be in her mid-50s based on the creases in her round but stern face - dark brown hair that comes to a point below her shoulder-blades, skin that seems to glow, and most strikingly white-gold eyes that don't have pupils.
	She wears comfortable though fit clothes - not quite the flowing robes of many other residents of the Eternal Comet, potentially that of a traveler on the Material Plane with a bit of fashion sense. If anything denotes her rank as a venerable astronomer, its an otherworldly staff she carries - crowned with a crystal that shifts in hue like the tail of the comet .

	Lectures cover planar navigation to celestial omens.
