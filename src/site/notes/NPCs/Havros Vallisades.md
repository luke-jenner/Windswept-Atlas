## Letters from Desk:

OLD Letter on top about [[Factions/VFD\|VFD]] - an organization that invariably inspired the Newfables, though Havros thought was long-gone based on their existence in the First Age - Ancestors of Archon - first age floating empire - remnants of that great civilization, maybe its heirs - regardless, they have a lot of information and tracking down living members could start the breakthrough Havros has been hoping for.
