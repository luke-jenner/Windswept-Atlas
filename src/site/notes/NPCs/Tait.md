### Letter to Glint

*I am apologies to start - Common is not my native tongue. I am still learning. Phoebe is helping write this. 

A pilgrim is never alone. Oft are they bonded to other initiates, and they are always among the stars. So ancient, the stars that have always been, that they have been with many a pilgrim. They guide. They glow. They show the pilgrim stories of many faces that are so meaningful and have stories that only the pilgrim can understand. 

I have seen you in those stars. You were alone, on a mountain in the dark. Rings of stars danced around you, though your own candlelight was unlit. From the light of the moon you had horns of power. A sign on your chest - a star of the Ars Almadel - was marked but dull. I think this is the lonely pilgrim inside of you. 

Pathfinding is never easy. Many paths are already paved and to travel one is to put your back to others. You may need to make your own path, drawn by the winds that push you along. Some paths may meet again farther along, as their orbits are intertwined. That may be us. I will try to not hold onto ill feelings for where the winds take us. 

I am still a student, holding a sail to my own winds. I hope to unveil the midnight-blue clandestine coastline by extending the glow of the lighthouses around our world. The Sounding Fury may be one of those lighthouses, though I have seen a larger, ancient light that gave the Fury their own. And so I may be on the precipice of a pilgrimage myself. 

(I do not conspire with Death, but I do know the stars around death are only ever transient. Maybe Death is a pilgrim?)
