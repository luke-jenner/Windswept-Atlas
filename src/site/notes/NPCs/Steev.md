### Bio, Upon Meeting The Not From Around Heres (February 23, 2012)

*Hi. My name is Steve.*

*I spent a month as a dog once and let me tell you it sucked. But thankfully, I'm human right now. I am currently about 26 years old, with short dark hair and I stand at a little over six feet tall. I'm fit, average build, and all in all, I'm in pretty good shape. For a chaos mage that is, I mean, most of us die by now. I guess I'm just lucky. Which doesn't help when you're on a date and the girl asks you to show her a spell. You try to make her hair turn blond and next thing you know she's a parrot. And then you have to explain to the innkeeper that the parrot is not your pet and you're not a pirate and that's just some silly stereotype and I'm sorry if I seem a bit scatterbrained. I tend to have a lot on my mind.*

*Like right now for example. I'm on a mission. I think. A week ago I was sent by the mage council to investigate the seismic shifts that have been tearing asunder the land as of late. I say I think because about six months ago, a spell I was working on backfired, blowing apart most of the east wing of the sage's tower, the headquarters of the mage council. I was kicked out. Probably because I killed the head of research in the explosion... Kassabram, Kassabrim, Kassa-something. I don't remember too well. Anyway, it's weird because he was the one who summoned me to sanctum and gave me the mission. We have some skilled necromancers, but none that good. And to top it off, the east wing is standing like nothing ever happened.*

*I mean, this stuff tends to happen to me a lot. Being a chaos mage means that you learn to take it all in stride. Smile and nod to what you believe to be a zombie, raised from the depths of hell and bent on revenge and accept that it will now send you on a dangerous mission for an order that you could have sworn excommunicated you just months ago. No, no, I'm not insane. This is just chaos stuff that happens. It's inevitable really, almost all chaos mages end up thrown around through time. Though most are at least trying to make it happen. I think I'm getting the hang of it though, I can almost do it on purpose. I mean, it happens to me fairly often, but so far always on accident. I remember my first time. I was 18 and just finishing my apprenticeship, my final task was to teleport myself from my quarters, to the mage's academy, several miles away. I showed up with a bang and a flash of smoke, right where I was supposed to. Only a week early. I passed on the second time around, but from then on, it seems as if I'm getting thrown around time more and more often.*

*But I'm on a tangent. My point is.. wait, did I have a point? Magic! Right, magic. [[World Lore/chaosether\|chaosether]] is a bit difficult to explain, so you'll have to bear with me. The first thing they tell you when you want to be a chaos mage is don't become a chaos mage. But the second thing they teach you is almost as useful. They teach you that anything is possible. That the only limit is your own imagination. And often that isn't a limit at all, things backfire and suddenly your imagination expands to hold the definition of tentacle beasts. Chaos mages don't deal with incantations or rituals like normal mages. We work with the mechanics behind such spells. The mechanics are rather vague and experimental, hence the nature of chaos magic. You can never really be sure of what's gonna happen.*

*There are three basic mechanics. Charging, Linking, and transferring. Charging is the first thing that a chaos mage learns, an initiation of sorts. We set up a link to the earth, letting us draw clean energy from it, or give excess energy to it. Chaos mages always keep this link open. It's saved my life more times than I can count. The earth is one of the few places we can get clean energy. I say clean because energy is a lot like water. Depending on where you draw it from, it has different things in it. If I pull energy from a fire for instance, Whatever spell I'm casting will probably light it's target ablaze.*

*That brings me to the next component, Linking. Linking simply creates a link between a two things. They can be anything, the floor, a person, a sword. A link is needed to safely move energy from one thing to another. Links can be any shape you can picture, They can be straight lines, paths, cones, whatever you create them to be.*

*That method of moving energy is called transferring. Transferring is usually just pushing or pulling energy between two ends of a link. And that's really it. Those three things are the basis to all the magic in the world. But real magic is so much more than that, right? You're right and wrong. I said that that was the base of chaos magic. We never play with pure mechanics when we cast spells. We'd kill ourselves in moments. Chaos magic truly shines when you study and use sigils to "color" the energy, giving you more control.*

*My fire energy from earlier would be an example of colored energy. I would add a fire sigil into a spell to cast a fire spell. Sigils are much harder than that however. By definition, sigils are vague. They are representations of concepts and tend to have many, many meanings. It's up to the chaos mage to focus his mind on the correct meaning to color the energy the desired way. Some common sigils are Heal, Hurt, Move, Create, Hide, and Hinder. There really is no set list, simply commonly used sigils.*

*And that's basically it. Now... who did you say you were? The- not from around here's? ...Well, I think that you would greatly benefit from having me aboard your team, it looks like you could use a mage, and I could use some friends to help me on my research.*
