Met [[Arcane Acquisitions Associated\|AAA]], [[PCs/Eevan\|Eevan]] in Mirtul of 2023 B.R., in their time on [[Eos/Halios\|Halios]] 

Once a Sage out of Altrinios, now an Undead Warlock.
	Race is questionable - humanoid, something between an elf and a githyanki
	Tall, gaunt - pallid skin glowing blue eyes
	Tattered dark robes adorned with arcane runes
	Staff made from a twisted, blackened branch
e
- Killed by an Undead Knight - or rather given a mortal wound, like a vampire would bite their converts
- Given a choice of taking up the helm or dying - he had "unfinished business" and sailed the Styx for a long time.
	- Protected & guided lost souls
- Re: Soul & The Weave
	- "What is dead isn't egtting any more dead... though this chaos in the weave seems to be sparking things of old, things forgotten."
	- "The Soul passes on - back into the Weave. Sometimes it disperses, sometimes it holds on. There's only so many beings that have that kind of control over it. And they usually got there from narcissism, egotism, and a grossly over-inflated self-worth. Don't get your hopes up."
