#### Ecken- Dwarven Gardener in the Cobalt Preserve 

- Gardener in Cobalt Preserve on [[Eos/Halios\|Halios]]

Stout dwarf, locks of emeral green casting down the back of their head with a short, shaped up trim in front. Their skin is weathered, though young - deep gray eyes. They're wearing earth-toned clothing that is adorned with a hefty double-belt strapped with gardening tools.
	Born into a family that tended the Mithril Halls of Dar'Rag, didn't quite have a place as their older brothers and sisters already held those so Ecken traveled. Eventually met a traveling astronomer in Willow that talked of an ethereal comet, where the natural and the magical converged. Ecken journaled of it and spoke to the plants in their journeys of it. One fateful day, in a sacred grove deep in the Mrost Realm (Star Mounts), a shimmering portal manifested to a celestial doorway - it was their calling to come to the Eternal Comet. 
	Upon their crossing, Ecken eventualy made kinship and was reconigzed for a unique connection to the natural world. Preserve of the Cobalt Archon took them in with open arms.<br>
	Now responsible for cultivating ethereal flora that graces the comet's gardens. Pulls many fruits and foods that are consumed by the folk of the comet, including:
	- Stardust Blossoms - ethereal spectrum flowers, often used by the House of Convalescence
	- Luminara Vines - produce radiant frutis that emit a gentle glow, rich in rejuvenating juice
	- Aetherial Grains - Staple food source
	- Astral Root Vegetables
	- Ephemeral Orchids
