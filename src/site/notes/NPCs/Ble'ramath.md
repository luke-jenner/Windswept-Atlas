Dragon Form: majestic sapphire dragon whose scales shimmer with an iridescent blue, resembling the vibrant hues of a clear summer sky. Her eyes, intelligent and perceptive, gleam with a wisdom earned through countless battles across the planes. She bears a series of intricate runic patterns along her wings and tail, remnants of her time as a planar warrior.

Despite her formidable size and strength,  moves with a graceful elegance. Her wings, when spread wide, catch the light like a cascade of radiant gemstones, and her serpentine body undulates with a mesmerizing fluidity.

**Elf form**: long, flowing silver hair with strands of crystalline blue - piercing contrast in her radiant blue eyes, like the irises of a tiger, sharp and attentive. Pointed elven ears are adorned with silver earrings, each with the sapphire blue with the same sheen of her scales. Slender, yet athletic frame - holds a confidence. 

Deep blue and obsidian robes embroidered with subtle draconic arcane patterns. Movements are sharp, pointed with intention, though not aggressive. As if she is embodying the calm before the storm.
