"Land of Four Corners / Land of Four Loves"

![Kawluurac-Summer-2022.png](/img/user/Images/Kawluurac-Summer-2022.png)

A land that is heavily divided - geologically and politically. Ripped apart by divine wars in the first age, Kawluurac is adorned by vast mountain ranges, countless rivers, towering plateaus and plunging valleys. The mysterious reaches of the Haunted Highlands of the north create stark contrast from the neigh-endless rainforests to the south. A land of disparate fertility, climates change rapidly as borders are drawn into the landscape itself. The plentiful mountains and surges of ether have attracted mysticism as well as buried it. 

After the Godswar and the end of the First Age, Kawluurac saw the rise and fall of many kingdoms, governments, provinces, and dynasties, as well as a prevalence of arcane intervention with the fragmented divinity. Many cults rose and began to feud, ushering in a time referred to as the Age of Demons; a catastrophic war across the Prime Material Plane that extended the Blood War between the Hells and the Abyss. Weakened and fractured by Willowan and Ellesionese conquerors, invasive planar evil was fought locally for lack of a wider, joint coalition. As the Red Wizards of Thay rose to might on their high plateau and purged demons through their own means, Ssarlona sought the aid of Willowan alliances overseas while other territories built their independence. 

As of late second age, Kawulraac is known by many Willowans as ‘Sylith’ due to the Sylithian traders they worked with. 

First Age - the Wild West
	-Pre-Netherese Fall
	-Dragon & Fiend Wars
	-Tiamat vs Zehir
	-Post-Netherese Fall
	-Godswar

Second Age - 
	-Transcontinental Trade
	-Export food from jungles, field crops, spices, as well as illicit drugs and poisons
	-Established governments, rise of cults
	-Age of Demons - Thay’s pact with Devils
	-Willowan Conquerors, indentured servitude overseas, extortion of trade
	-Sylithian War/Ssarlona Independence 

Third Age - 
	-Thayan Expansion - literal geographic expansion as the Thayan Plateau has begun to magically grow - heightening its escarpments while pushing out into the Ssarlonian Jungles, many fear Szass Tam is seeking to extend his dominion and may be on the brink of military action or otherwise. With no clear political force powerful enough to stop them on the Kawluraac continent after the War with Willow severely weakened Ssarlona, anxiety grows in its cities 

Geology : Mountains & highlands, river basins, coastal plains 

First Age civilizations & ground empires built temple complexes in the highlands/mountains towards places of power, many city-centers used astronomical phenomena as direction & zoomorphic structures for civic planning.
