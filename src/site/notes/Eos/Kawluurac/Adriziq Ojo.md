**The Academy of Adriziq Ojo

Also known as “The Left Eye of Knowledge”, or simply “The Left Eye'', to common folk in the city of Velde Aerdrie, The Academy of Adriziq Ojo (Ad-reh-ZEEK Oh-Ho) is one of the most prominent and diverse magic academies on the entire continent. The City was playing host to many of the refugees from the war with Willow, bringing in a new found knowledge of other cultures. The Academy saw this as a massive opportunity to gain new information on whatever it could, and began to seek out any child to young adult with magical ability. The goal was simple. Knowledge is a gift and it should be given and shared. In the 15 years since the events of Copys family, the academy has shifted to a new form of hierarchy to better direct the energy and resources of the Academy itself. Lead by Headmaster Chaima Firahel, the Academy split into three different divisions: The Arcane division, run by Archmage Arcane: Tlanextic, The Divine division, run by Divine Eye: Afa Kallista, and the Primal division, run by Primal Elder: E’min Pentandra.

### Headmaster Chaima Firahel 
(KAI-ma fee-ra-Hel) Is the newest Headmaster of the academy, with a tenure of 43 years. Highly qualified, she was the previous Primal Elder, she began a program to reach out to the families of refugees. Her goal was to assimilate them into the widespread knowledge of the academy. For an exchange of knowledge of the customs and artifacts that some were able to bring from their homes, the Academy would train any and all children in some form of magical art; and for every artifact that had been taken by previous generations of academy archeologists, she would extend the same invitation. In the most recent five years alone, this has doubled the size of the academy, leading to new expansions. It has also made the Academy one of the largest cultural exchanges on the planet. With the program in full effect, she has also sought out adventurers and others to escort envoys of future students, and other odd jobs. Not long after the academy hired (put group name there), she took a passing interest in their exploits and stories and given many a residence in the academy as thanks, and let others use the academies great libraries and teachers to further their own magical knowledge. Humble, and admittedly easily amused, she will sometimes directly work with students that struggle, or students that are being ostracized, to better acclimate them to the environment of the city and the Academy itself. 

### Archmage Arcane, Tlanextic,
is in fact the oldest living being currently at the Academy. An Eladrin that was displaced from their domain in the fey, came to this plane after delving deeper into the wonders of Arcane magic. A brief time spent studying in the Academy, they went back into the feywild, searching for remnants of their culture and home to bring back with them. When they returned, the years that they had spent were mere weeks on the material plane. This rapid change in development sent some chaos through the arcane division. Tlanextic already had exceeded the power of all of their fellow classmates. This propelled them into the staff at the academy, teaching history and magic of the feywild to the select few who could accept its nature. It was their creativity that helped get them to the level of Arcane Archmage, twisting spells ever so slightly to their whims. They always champion creativity and nurture anything that appears to be new, citing their own feywild essence as motivation. Their time in the feywild left a ripple of it, and things don’t always “follow the rules” around them, creating exciting possibilities and memories. 

### Divine Eye, Afa Kullista (A-fa kuhl-LEE-sta) 
seems to be the embodiment of wisdom itself. This elder Tortle is a cleric under Mystra, and has been for his entire life. His core belief, and the belief that was driven into the new foundation of the Divine Division of the Academy, is “There is divinity in devotion.” Under this core belief, he has moved a curriculum that champions that idea, teaching students under the divine division that the gods or ideals you serve will become known to you in time, but in devotion to one's self, magic is found. This common cause was able to unite the feuding clerics of gods and religious beliefs in the academy. When a student found a specific cause or god to support, they would be gifted a small starting fund to get them to their destination. Those who remain at the academy either dedicate themselves to Ioun or Mystra, or to oaths that serve the Academy (Watchers, Devotion) where Afa has guided them through meditation. Afa believes that Mystra is responsible for all magic, and thanks her for the gift of it on a daily basis. He is also not above using his magical ability to play small harmless pranks on any student, which is a departure from his very gruff appearance, and manor. He never yells, or breaks character except amongst those whom he trusts most, or for those who need it the most. 

### Primal Elder, E’min Pentandra 
(EE-min pent-and-rah) is the newest addition to the Mythril Posts. As a half-orc, her life was not always easy, overcoming various hardship in coming to the academy. However, once there, she was able to flourish by an innate understanding of life and mortality and dedication. This quickly earned her notoriety amongst fellow rangers and druids, who began to idolize her. She was quick to remove herself from the pedestal and from the academy itself, seeking to help repair the land of a war torn continent. After a few years of travel and energy spent to try and repair some of the scars on the nature of the land, she returned to the Academy in order to try and spread her own knowledge to those there. She moved up through the faculty, her ideas spreading like wildfire, and the ever growing respect for mortality of all living things is to be celebrated in death as well, because in death there is rebirth and renewal. A warm individual by nature, and temperature, she rarely uses her own styles of magic to better connect with those who study under the Primal Division of the Academy. However, she has also been known to show off at times, accompanied by her hummingbird fire spirit.**
