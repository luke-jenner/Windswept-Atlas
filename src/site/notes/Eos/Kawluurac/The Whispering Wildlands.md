Pressed against the northern coast of Kawluurac - a desert of ice and snow, separated from the realms of Thay and Ssarlona by the jagged Haunted Highlands (known locally, Crystal Peaks). Landscape of dense, desiccated forests, rolling mountains, and icy tundra - the Biting North that encompasses this region as well as the islands of **Katyr Steppes**. Tucked beyond the edge of Thay and Ssarlona’s reach, past the shadowed dangers of the dense, frozen foliage lies the dwarven citadel of **Daria’merour**, which has become the home of many generations of elves who survived the collapse of a First Age city in the region.
