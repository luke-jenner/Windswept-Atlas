[[Eos/Kawluurac/Kawluurac\|Kawluurac]]
One of the greatest concentrations of magical might in Kawluurac. Thay is ruled by an ancient lich, Szass Tam, and the nation’s Council of Zulkirs in a ruthless magocracy. The council’s will is enacted by regional tharchions and bureaucrats, leaving the ruling Red Wizards to focus on magical study and more important arcane manners. 

For a time, living mages couldn’t hope to advance in Thay: Szass Tam promoted undeath as a means of existence with boundless possibilities, and held back those who didn’t agree with this philosophy. The recent battles with the demon Eltab, however, have prompted Szass Tam to loosen this stricture - the living now have hope of ascending within the Red Wizards, even if that hope is merely to advance to a high station within the cadre of Tam’s servants.

### Thaymount
**- Also known as High Thay, a citadel city built around ancient wreckage of a fallen First Age city, crashed into the side of the Crystal Peaks
- Currently the seat of power under the rule of High Regent Szass Tam
- Outlanders are forbidden from traveling up the inner escarpment, past Eltabar, unless directly escorted by one of the nation’s Red Wizards - seldomly done
- Barracks for Thayan military, built up during the third age post-war with Willow - comprised of thousands of gnolls, darkenbeats, orcs, and orogs
- Citadel, rebuilt from an ancient fallen citadel, complex network of arcane chambers
- Doomvaults underneath the Citadel, grand dungeon sued to conduct experiments on the chosen of the gods and more
- Thayvian mines, reaping from the Crystal Peaks 
- Sits in a region of rugged, volcanic mountains - likely volcanic due to ancient ether that seeped into the soil after the fall of a First Age city and has since gone catalytic
