[[Eos/Ellesion/Ellesion\|Ellesion]]
*Built on a rocky promontory jutting into the sea - ascending cliffs serve as natural walls with plateaus building the city itself, leads to a high fortress - a naval base for the city’s port & harbor. 

*Atop the city’s walls, tall, colorful flags and ribbons flutter from poles. Traders, guards, and workers come and go through a grand gate opposite of a bridge, passing from the surrounding mines and coastal farmlands into the winding maze of tall, powerful structures.
  
*As you watch - a pale mist rises from within the city. It drifts through the gates and breaks over the city walls as if the entire city were exhaling one great breath.*

### Culture & Rumors

- Everyone is talking about the last few months - awaiting an answer from the Firefall Keep
- High military presence, though much of the city is stronghold - their academies are clearly driven through military & preparation
- Also high presence of Soldiers of the Dawnfather from Arsiil - some on few days leave, some as general liaison 
- Rumors of rising military tensions - Elpizo historically stays defensive and non-interventional, most are hoping conflict stays far to the north 
- Merchants are currently a bit woesome over pirates - hiring adventured sailors as guards on the seas
- Sailors are talking about unusually heavy storms - most are just shrugging it off as spring and say it’s always bad this time of year 
- Young money types are heading to Neo Fanari or even Altrinios to get aboard sky ships - lot of money to be made exploring the skies

Owner: Spark on the Wind - Tabaxi from Votan - speaks quickly, without pausing, offering seemingly cryptic questions without connections

Answers questions quickly without detail, then adds on irrelevant statements 
	Do you often walk through a door and forget why you were there? Or forget why that happens so often? 
	Have you ever misplaced your coinpurse, and instinctively believed it must be stolen?
	Have you ever taken a loved one on a hike and realized they hated it?
	We’re all just swimming along, some of us floating… but then I dream of the great wave. 
	Did you dream you would one day be standing where you were, or were your dreams vague and confusing like the rest of ours?
	How self conscious do you get when you tip your server? 
	What I need from you is to imagine a castle in the sky, majestic and wondrous, then imagine how a plumber would see that same castle.
	Those little superstitions you keep, habitual rituals, tell an awful lot about where you’ve been and who you’ve been watching. 
	Cemeteries are where the dead go to rest, but when I went there to rest I couldn’t fall asleep.
	I mourn when a trophy gathers dust. Those statues in the Park, they may be in mourning too.
	I have a sweet tooth. I’m not fond of pets, either. 
	If a curse can inhabit an object… I would like to write the story of a day in the life of an object with a blessing. 
	Have you ever tried to sit and just listen - have you ever been somewhere without the sounds brought on by other people? 
	Are you planning a trip soon?

### Neighborhoods


Chromanticore District
	Relatively new part of the city - still undergoing construction, particularly along forested stretch being cleared 
	Even though locals don’t recollect the fog and beast attacks (that Ioanna’s gargoyles do to impede work), they’re aware of accidents, vandalism, and missing workers delay construction 
	When party nears the forest, they find a large construction site full of scaffolding & equipment
	Laborers clear stumps and raise the frames of new houses while armed guards keep an eye on the nearby forest for signs of trouble 
	When they arrive, Foreman Rania Hadjitzi approaches them**

**Phoenix District** 

	The oldest area in the city, adjacent to the ancient citadel known as the Fire-Fall Keep - populated mostly by nobles and wealthy elite. 
	
	People know many have been harmed on the streets and fear that some gang has infiltrated the city 
	
	The tea shop is famous and is easy to find by asking any passerby 
	
	The Tea Shop
	
	Oldest shop in Elpizo, simply called the “Tea Shop” when it was built hundreds of years ago
	
	Decorated with hundreds of teacups arrayed on shelves; many cups are painted and bear silhouetted scenes - the names of famous past patrons, adventurers, nobles, and royals 
	
	Danaë - neutral good satyr 
	
	Greets everyone who enters, offers to prepare a pot of [Mulhein or Calithil](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10SGlOyaPmIgTcHr90DnVC02Jo4pfjAVvoaYcwQl9Aio/edit) tea 
	
	Grows vague if asked about recent attacks near her shop - doesn’t want the area to be considered dangerous
	
	If tea is purchased or Persuasion check, can convince her to mention two nobles attacked near her shop were named Yannis and Alaro - a dwarf and an elf - and that they often play Dragonchess and a nearby hall, a raised courtnard that’s the social center of the Phoenix District 
	
	  
	
	Dragonchess Yards
	
	Three blocks away from the tea shop - a large park with winding pathways up and down small switchbacks, adorned with fountains and pillars
	
	  
	
	Dragonchess Halls are popular gathering places, particularly for old or noble families - slow paced, but social
	
	  
	
	At the yard, dozens of pairs of players concentrate at tables covered in circular black and white pieces. Guards or attendants can easily direct to Yannis and Alaro
	
	The two are in middle of an intense game
	
	Not unfriendly, though not interested in talking at the moment 
	
	Happy to talk after their game (3 hours)
	
	DC16 Persuasion can convince them to take a break and talk
	
	DC16 Insight can look at game and point out strategic opportunites to both sides, causing game to conclude in 10 minutes 
	
	  
	
	Yannis & Alaro
	
	Call for lentils and wine and ask their business, willingly share following:
	
	•During a visit to Tea Shop after dusk about a week ago, they were both nearly killed
	
	•Both recall seeing a strange woman lingering near the shop
	
	•Next thing either of them remembered, they were waking up - passerby found them near the shop and summoned a priest of Pelor to aid them 
	
	  
	
	Neither knows who the woman was, have no memory of the fog
	
	DC14 Persuasion, one reluctantly reveals they think she dressed like an oracle - an awakened soothsayer -  but was a ghastly visage 
	
	Don’t know why a spirit would be lurking around the tea shop, but suspect the witchy proprietor Danaë would know 
	
	  
	
	Yannis - very interested in arcane technology - wants to import more from Neo Fanari, has heard of trade routes going south into the continent as well
	
	-Originally from Votan, across the Skilathos - a city that is also booming from innovation and industry - came here twenty years ago, bringing with him wealth to invest in industry 
	
	  
	Alaro - an Elpizo native for over two centuries, took up arms in the Wind Walker Rebellion, now very interested in making use of newfound wealth to expand and bolster Elpizo to rival Arsiil**
