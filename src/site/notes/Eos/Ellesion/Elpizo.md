[[Eos/Ellesion/Ellesion\|Ellesion]]
*Built on a rocky promontory jutting into the sea - ascending cliffs serve as natural walls with plateaus building the city itself, leads to a high fortress - a naval base for the city’s port & harbor. 

*Atop the city’s walls, tall, colorful flags and ribbons flutter from poles. Traders, guards, and workers come and go through a grand gate opposite of a bridge, passing from the surrounding mines and coastal farmlands into the winding maze of tall, powerful structures.
  
*As you watch - a pale mist rises from within the city. It drifts through the gates and breaks over the city walls as if the entire city were exhaling one great breath.*

### The Tea Shop

Oldest shop in Elpizo, simply called the “Tea Shop” when it was built hundreds of years ago

Decorated with hundreds of teacups arrayed on shelves; many cups are painted and bear silhouetted scenes - the names of famous past patrons, adventurers, nobles, and royals 

Danaë - neutral good satyr 

Greets everyone who enters, offers to prepare a pot of [Mulhein or Calithil](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10SGlOyaPmIgTcHr90DnVC02Jo4pfjAVvoaYcwQl9Aio/edit) tea 
  
### Dragonchess Yards

Three blocks away from the tea shop - a large park with winding pathways up and down small switchbacks, adorned with fountains and pillars

Dragonchess Halls are popular gathering places, particularly for old or noble families - slow paced, but social
