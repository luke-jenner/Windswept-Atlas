Vast valley of grasslands and wetlands between the [[Eos/Ellesion/Folos Forest\|Folos Forest]] and the Ember Plateaus in [[Eos/Ellesion/Ellesion\|Ellesion]]- Hetos-Run is home to many leonin. Here roam vast herds of knot-horned gazelle, flocks of elephant birds, prides of lean lions, and a menagerie of other beasts. Predatory griffins and manticores regularly range over the region’s grassy seas, while beings like the anvilwroughts of Mount Velus or the etherborn often experience Hetos-Run as their first glimpse of a wider world. 

Unspoiled by roads or buildings, Hetos-Run is a land of natural beauty, where the plains and sky appear to go on forever. Craggy stone formations and ancient ruins dot windswept grasslands and plateaus, shading into scrubby badlands, rocky hills, and unwelcoming mountains. At the sun’s height, the grasslands shine like beaten gold, and the sunsets are incomparable. Magnificent storms spread clouds in a rainbow of colors, creating vistas exhilarating to those brave enough to weather them. The hills yield ancient treasures and a bounty of precious metals and stones. At night, movements of the stars are striking, but images of the gods seem to keep their distance from this land where few pay them honor. 

Leonin prides and other druidic locale and etherborn guard their lands implacably, and without a good reason to be there - or a guide to vouch for one’s presence - outsiders are often chased away.
