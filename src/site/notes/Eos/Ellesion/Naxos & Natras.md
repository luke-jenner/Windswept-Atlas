### The Lovers
An archipelago - connected to the [[Eos/Ellesion/Ellesion\|Ellesion]] mainland deep beneath the surface, in myth is said to have been created when [[World Lore/Primordials/Thassa\|Thassa]]-Istishia wept over the acts of destruction of her first children, Umberlee and Talos. In her distress, Thessa-Istishia formed the two islands that would display all that was beautiful of her realms, and in turn gave birth to the deity of beauty, Sune.

Sune’s history is then mostly told through her various romances and flirtations with other gods - tales exist of her relationships with practically every god except Talos, Umberlee, Tempus, and Kord, whom Sune abhorred for their acts of destruction. 

Naxos and Natras truly are home to natural beauty in their constant shifting nature, their attractive lures of both sight and treasure, as well as their thorns of danger and ferocity. The changing nature of Thassa & Sune’s influence on the islands maintain an opacity of mysticism, making them nigh impossible to keep an accurate chart or map of. Thus, even the most famed locations appear on no map, and sailors or explorers might spot them when or wherever Thassa-Istishia wills. Legends tell Erastés, of a hidden city that is found and resided by those whose hearts yearn for nothing but wanderlust.

### Sune In Sorrow

For something to be truly beautiful, it must never stay the same. Because when love stagnates, it becomes transparent. That is all it will ever be. Beauty is fleeting, moment to moment, and the land should be as well. 

Embarking on a journey through Naxos and Natras is not merely a physical exploration but a venture into the mystical unknown. The shifting nature of the mountains challenges the mind and spirit, offering a unique experience that few dare to undertake.
