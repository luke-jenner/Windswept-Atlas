Rebuilt after its destruction in [[World Lore/The Godswar\|the Godswar]], Néo Fanári is the heir of the mythical city of Fanári, once the shining beacon of [[Eos/Ellesion/The Skilathos Sea\|The Skilathos Sea]]. It is known to the Altrinioans as the farthest reaches of the [[Eos/Ellesion/Altrinios\|Altrinios]] coalition, though of all the populations in that coalition, it is the one that has the least feeling of belonging to the city-state - either by distance to [[Eos/Ellesion/Altrinios\|Altrinios]] or by its own history and culture, or by the simple power of the city itself. The city has inherited all the myths and traditions of its predecessor, proud of its past, but promising not to make mistakes of the powerful city-states. The city has created immediate separation of politic and religion, removing all affinity for gods from their citadels. Not indicating neglect towards the gods, the religiosity of the inhabitants is palpable in most houses in the city. Once run by an archpriest of the elven god Correlon, the Arch Heart, the city is now governed by the [[Factions/Triarchy\|Triarchy]] - a confluence of leaders from the city’s navy, the city’s engineers, and the city’s artisans. 

While separate in politics from their origins of Corellon, Néo Fanári still has many elves that did not retreat into the Folos Forest, as well as many that immigrated back to Ellesion after The Retreat from Ethelia across the Starfallen Sea. Many of these elves uphold high values of art, music, and craft, while many have set engineering sights on beauty in advancement of technology - over the last 50 years or more, the city has begun building upwards through infrastructural brunestone, becoming a semi-floating city.

A very indoor-outdoor space, three levels, four in some towers, with a very green patio that is cantilevered to extend out over the cliffs edge. Entirely lit by arcane lamps, some panels on the outside that flit thin, ribbon like lights across them making out shifting designs themed for the holiday, occasionally forming and freezing in the shape of the the tavern’s name and branding
