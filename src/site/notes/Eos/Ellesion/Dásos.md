Built on top of the ruins of an ancient First Age city, Dásos was largely repopulated by elves immigrating from the Willowan province of Ethelia in the Second Age, and now in the Third Age is once again seeing growth and development. Primal magicks paired with a reverence for the gods, Dásos is a city of deep mysticism and wonder. Recently, the city has become a traversing space as adventurers find respite between the city-state of Altrinios, the wonders of the Folos Forest, the Hetos-Run, and the farther expanse of Ellesion.
