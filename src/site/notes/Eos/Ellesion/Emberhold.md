Walled city-state atop cliffs and plateaus - few have ever dared to attack its famed fortress, the Lacadaemon.
Culture of feared warriors  that centers around perfecting the mind and body for war. 

### Monarchy 
ruled by a monarch drawn from an ancient lineage. Monarchs pass to eldest child, though any sibling or first cousin can challenge this succession and claim the throne by besting the heir in single combat. 

Currently, the monarchy is in a state of turmoil. King Anarth has died and his wife, Queen Galadina has disappeared. An Oracle of The Stormlord, the queen is said to have transformed into a pillar of fire and vanished into the wind, but until her death is certain, the Stratioa are reluctant to name a new monarch. King Anarth & Queen Galadina have no children, so the king’s niece, Penelope, acts as regent, attempting to guide the city-state through what is sure to be a difficult transition.

Rumors are spreading that King Anarth isn’t dead. He, or perhaps some shimmering simulacrum of him, has been seen at the head of squads of satyr hoplites, wielding an ax that billows with smoke and drips searing lava. 
### Euo

Warrior class of Emberhold. Claim descent from the seven warriors who first established Lacadaemon after The Fall of the Flying Cities of the First Age. Though the families now number more than seven, with membership in the class no longer being strictly hereditary. Anyone can earn a place among them by claiming a victory in the annual Vespakroan Games. More commonly, members of Euo families lose their place of privilege if they fail to fulfill their obligation to serve in the Emberhold military.
### Stratioa
The Emberhold military is formed of wandering bands of warriors (drawn from Euo families) known as Stratioa. Outside of the walls of Lacadaemon, the stratioa camp in the forests and fields, hunt game for food, and train younger warriors as they go. Their tasks are to search for monsters that have strayed into Emberhold territory and to protect travelers. 

Stratioa forces are divided into three types of duty and armed appropriately for the task before them:

>**Proskos**
Rugged forces of wanderers patrol Emberhold’s borders, defending against invasion or attack by monsters that dwell in the mountains, foothills, and badlands around Emberhold territory. They are armed and armored for speed and agility, allowing them to move stealthily and strike unexpectedly.
**Monokos**
Most elite forces of the stratioa, the so-called wolves contend with threats that the Proskos can’t handle alone. After the guerilla tactics of the Proskos have softened up a target, the heavily armored Monokos march to finish the task. 
**Kidemai**
The watchers are the guardians of the Lacadaemon who protect the fortress from invaders and maintain order within its walls. 

### [[Volamtar\|Volamtar]] (Blazers of Fresh Trails)

Prominent spellcasters, the Volamtar are a sect of wayfaring priests and rangers who revere nature spirits and who inhabit fiery rifts in the mountains. While the original Volamtar have been around since the First Age, during the Second Age many dwarves that were followers of [Marthammor Duin](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Marthammor_Duin) found camaraderie and common life with the Volamtar, and since the tradition has upheld many mountain traditions. The ancient practices are viewed as primitive but powerful, and Emberhold citizens of any background might risk making a pilgrimage into the mountains to hear a Volamtar prophecy.**
