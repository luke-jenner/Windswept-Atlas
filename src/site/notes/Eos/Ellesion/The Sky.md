Above [[Eos/Ellesion/Ellesion\|Ellesion]] & [[Eos/Ellesion/The Skilathos Sea\|The Skilathos Sea]]

**Gayle**: - Nestled on a massive, bioluminescent rock of ancient brunestone - Buildings are constructed from materials that are supported by its evocation magicks and all emit a soft glow - streets are connected by suspension bridges that reverse engineer the levitation effects. Inhabitants harness the island’s evocation energy to power their tech and defenses.

**Circos Bay** - Sprawling fortress settlement - network of interconnected islands. Hub of trade and diplomacy of many sky settlements - envoys from different factions garther to negotiate alliances. Tends to be a bit politics heavy, can easily get strong armed into supporting a sailing union or faction that you otherwise might not. Architecture is a blend of various cultures.

**Tempest Reach **- Perpetual thunderstorms - gnomes originally built it up to withstand fierce winds and lightning strikes, druidic practices that harness the chaotic energy for magical purpose. Storm Summoning are a predominant tempest guild - unsure if they’re a faction of Umberlee.

[[Eos/Ellesion/Nimbus Nexus\|Nimbus Nexus]] - Bit of a melting pot, that one. Interconnected floating black marble islands with magical bridges - lot of traders seeking better or less conspicuous deals than you’ll find on the surface. Less military, more likely to come into contact with pirates. Powerful arcane dealers currently have a hold on the place - tend to be a bit more corrupt. A lot of strong wards on the market - you’ll lose limbs for stealing. 

**Sylph Shire** - Forested island - a lot of gnomes, aarakocra, and the like. Gorgeous village built into the forest’s canopy. They’re peaceful, though have taken arms over the last half a century as more aggressive types and pirates have tried to raid and pillage, or invade by taking up residence in the forest. Now it’s tough to pass by aerial scouts that won’t demand you stay docked outside of the forests. 

**Tweedhaven** - Wherever it is currently - big ol village that tends to float around the place, a longstanding gnomish haven. 

**Stoichstrand** - Mysterious, a bit dangerous but if you’re in for the arcane anomalies, that’ll be one. Swirling pools of elemental energies surround the island - if you ask me, leaking in from other planes. There’s a settlement there - haven’t been there myself, but have seen merchants, sailors, and even ambitious pirates and adventurers heading in. 
(Inhabitants are skilled planar travelers, town serves as a hub for interplanar exploration and research - architecture incorporates elements from different planes.)
