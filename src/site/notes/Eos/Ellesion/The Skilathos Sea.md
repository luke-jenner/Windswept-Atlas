The boundary waters between Ellesion and Kawluurac, the Sea of Skilathos has been a shifting space of adventure and mystery. Latent magics of primordials lay dormant, stoking the curiosities of mortals in the First Age until the sea became the battlegrounds of gods at the end of the First Age. Into the Second Age, the Skilathos was yet again a battleground as it was a highly coveted resource for expanding and collapsing empires. Into the Third Age, the sea remains the neutral, international territory between the two continents and is passage of much trade - both legal and smuggling - between cultures. Many of its shore cities maintain high military presence and strict governing bodies to protect themselves, while others remain smaller, becoming fluid hubs of commerce. The land is now known far and wide as a place for lively trade, vibrant art, performance, and excellent food - as well as the indulgence of vice, piracy, and illicit business.
