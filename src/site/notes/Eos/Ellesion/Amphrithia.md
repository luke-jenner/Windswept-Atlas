Kingdom of Amphrithia, in the [[Eos/Ellesion/Alukiir Sea\|Alukiir Sea]], home to a long dynasty of Triton built from the remains of a fallen First Age city. During [[World Lore/The Godswar\|the Godswar]], secluded themselves from the surface in worship of [[World Lore/Primordials/Thassa\|Thassa]], a Primordial of the Sea - protector of intangible things such as ancient knowledge, long voyages, and gradual change. 

Recently, the Amphrithian Crown was deposed by a military coup led by Veyeon, an outcasted prince that through ambition, sought to strengthen Amphrithia’s sway in wars to come. Veyeon’s coup has been criticized by Amphrithian people as a strike against the slow, gradual change of Thassa, though Veyeon has appealed to her essential nature of change and resculpting.
