Together, the Archipelago of the Ellesion Seas makeup the eastern coasts of the continent, and are fabled to be the realm of [[World Lore/Primordials/Thassa\|Thassa]]-Istishia, the now dormant water primordial and dawn titan. Of all primordials, Thassa-Istishia took a neutral stance in the Dawn War, only desiring change from the status quo. As the war raged on, Thassa descended into the moving waters of Eos, giving birth to Umberlee, Talos, and their younger sister, Sune. 

Being the domain of [[World Lore/Primordials/Thassa\|Thassa]], the Ellesion Seas hide an amazing array of creatures, including the entire triton civilization. Their legendary dangers range from deadly reefs and wandering islands to predatory beasts and devastating krakens. Ever-changing, the Ellesion Seas are a realm of impossible sights and constant danger, the setting of legendary odysseys and the crucible of heroes. 

Of the numerous, shifting waters, the **<font color="#00b0f0">Alukiir Sea</font>** - in Elven, the “Gem of All Waters” - is the heart of [[World Lore/Primordials/Thassa\|Thassa]]’s domain. At its northern tip, the Alukiir accepts waters from both the bold and emblazoned [[Eos/Ellesion/Hetos-Run\|Hetos-Run]] and the ethereal and mystical [[Eos/Ellesion/Folos Forest\|Folos Forest]], sewing the sea with magicks from all of Ellesion. In the First Age, the Alukiir Sea was the crash site of a then-abandoned falling city, creating a sprawl of sunken settlement and treasure that has since been claimed by the once-nomadic triton peoples. 

The majority of tritons in the Third Age are devoted in their reverence to [[World Lore/Primordials/Thassa\|Thassa]]-Istishia and rigorously protect her domain, often treating surface-dwelling sailors as trespassers. Tritons make most of their goods from materials harvested from the deep, but have also developed ingenious forms of metallurgy - largely based around volcanic sea vents - and chemical etching, crafting wares that rival those made on land. The endless array of live and unpredictable changes of the sea make tritons regularly witnesses to wonders. As a result, most tritons have a natural curiosity, ever seeking to see and learn more, but know they’ll never fathom all the wonders of the world.

Although numerous triton cultures exist throughout the Ellesion Seas, many of those closest to the shore are led by priests of Thassa-Istishia. Triton warriors enact their leader’s will, with many specializing in doing battle against massive beasts or ships sailing the surface. The most wary communities might even employ shorethieves, tritons adept at using magical disguises to infiltrate land-bound towns to watch and steal from dryfolk.
