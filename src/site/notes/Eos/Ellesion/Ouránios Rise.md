## Mount Sinaeus

- **Geography**: Mount Sinaeus is an imposing, solitary peak that rises dramatically from the surrounding rugged landscape, often cloaked in mist or low-hanging clouds. Its upper slopes are treacherous, composed of jagged, ice-slick rocks and deep crevasses. The summit is crowned with a natural stone spire, said to pierce the heavens, with views that stretch endlessly over the horizon.
- **Atmosphere**: The air near Mount Sinaeus is thick with an almost tangible sense of otherworldliness. Visitors often describe hearing whispers carried on the wind, as though the mountain itself is alive with ancient secrets.
- **Stellar Connection**: The mountain is perpetually bathed in starlight. Even during the brightest days, the star _Solus Major_ burns brightly above it, casting an eerie glow and acting as a celestial marker. During the night, the constellations seem closer, sharper, and more vibrant than anywhere
