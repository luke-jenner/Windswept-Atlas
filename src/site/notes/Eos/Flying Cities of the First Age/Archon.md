A Flying City over [[Eos/Ellesion/Ellesion\|Ellesion]] in the First Age. Rivaled by  [[Netharis\|Netharis]] over Northern Kawluurac and Willo over the Heartlands

Most likely rose from what is currently Tafos Lake in the Folos Forest

Archons set out on an Ethereal Conquest, building cities in the Ethereal Plane suchÂ  as [[Eos/Halios\|Halios]] while keeping their discovery a secret from the rival flying cities ([[Netharis\|Netharis]]). Eventually, the ambition of the Archons stirred betrayals & spilt secrets as the gates to the Ethereal Plane were open. 

An elite order of Archons sought to bring Law & Light to Chaos - using "Fires of Amaunator" to forge blades of the sun ([[Dawnbringer\|Dawnbringer]])

Ddi they fall because they drew the ire of the gods? 

Archons persisted past the Godswar, though they became quiet, lesser beings. Many went into hiding. Solyssia of Altrinios descends from a line of Archons. Some formed [[Factions/VFD\|VFD]].

# The Archons
- First-age civilization that was always trying to ascend
- Placed power and belief in 'gnosis' and the acquiescence of knowledge over reverence for the divine
- Had always resented the gods, in a time when few did - largely seen as the probelmatic anarchists of the First Age 
- Believed the world was strife and pain - material nature of things was not the purest of life, and that there was better 
	- The Gods had access to it - why shouldn't everyone?
- Driven by research of transcendence, learned about the nature of the weave in unparalleled ways 
	- Used learned magic to enrich their societies and daily life
	- Were likely the first of the flying cities to ascend, before Willo, [[Netharis\|Netharis]], Veskos, & [[Eos/Flying Cities of the First Age/Amphrithios\|Amphrithios]]... shortly followed by their rivals, Willo & [[Netharis\|Netharis]]
- An ancient [[World Lore/Apocrypha\|Apocrypha]] of the Archons wrote that we are ethereal beings - [[World Lore/Etherborn\|Etherborn]] forced into the mortal & material world
