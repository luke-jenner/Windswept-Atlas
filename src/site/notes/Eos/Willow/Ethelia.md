**Ethelian Region - Forest region. Home to Fey’Ri and some Elves. 
[[Eos/Willow/Willow (Continent)\|Willow (Continent)]]

**Rivers**: 
- Heylelian - split from Lake Heylel, down to Ethelvarden
- Celebrant - Descending from the Zan Mountains, down to Ethelvarden
- Sirion - Splitting west from Lake Heylel, down to Vel - dividing East Ethelia from West Ethelia

**Mountains**:
- The Far Hills - western facade, dividing coastal from inner Ethelia, running along the Evalir Way
- Nova Aros - Southern Mountains, surrounding Lake Ethralei and descending to Ethelia
### Ethelia

Elven home city in Willow. Walled. ~50,000. Little Crownsguard occupation. Built along mountains in forest. Hosts elves that are Willowan Citizens, though retains its own Elder Council. General elitism of elves, leads to rumors of conspiracy with Ellesion. Did supply soldiers to fight during Sylithian War though only to defend Willow. After war ended, soldiers returned home. 
91% Elven, 5% Fey’ri, 2% Human, 2% other

Founded by the sorceress **Ethralei** in the wake of the Godswar, Ethelia marked the first major elven civilization in the Heartlands. Whereas many Elven netherese courts took home in Ellesion and others fled to the Feywild, many began returning to Ethelia when Ethralei found the realm safe to return. These survivors built a new home, taking inspiration from their temporary home among the fey, and formed foundations of Ethelia. Two millennium later, Ethelia stands as the proud, defiant cultural and economic center of elven society on this continent.

Government: Governed by Ethelian King, a hereditary monarch who appoints proven individuals to offices alongside them. After the Willowan-Ethelian Union (900 years prior), the Ethelian King retained their wardenhood over the Ethelian Region, though under Willowan Crown authority and with protections from the Willowan Kingdom. 

Wardens carry titles and net of responsibilities to guide the city into a continued safety and prosperity. The Ethelian King acts as head of the city guard, though they delegate this responsibility to a Vice Protector when leading armies of Ethelia abroad.

The Guildrunner managers the city’s treasury and oversees commerce within Ethelia’s borders. The Voice of Memory is a heralded keeper of history and culture, and is often seen interacting with the elven people, gathering new memories for the archives. The Ethelian King has always been of Ethralei’s bloodline, and is responsible for keeping order within Ethelia and its territories, and within the Wardens themselves. 

Elven traditions that date back to before the Godswar. Arts are lauded and revered, pursuit of knowledge is respected and encouraged, and some training in refined martial techniques is culturally respected. Trade between other cities and nations is understood to be healthy & beneficial, but most foreign trade is relegated to outer areas of the city. Few foreigners ever see the inner city. Delicate crafts by Ethelian hands are sought after by collectors around the world, so many take up the trade for both profit and honor. 

Extraordinarily long lives, having children is a rare, and largely regulated process. Prospective parents must gain approval from the office of the Voice of Memory to procreate, and any unapproved children are sent out of the city to be raised in outposts or outercites. 

Severe prejudice against humans and their outsider allies. 

Perpetual shade of thick, green canopy of the forest - cool weather throughout the summer months. 

**Memory Ward** - Mind of Ethelia. District home to many Dreamweavers - elves who have dedicate their waking and sleeping lives to the protection of their heritage. Obsessed with tradition and the past. 

**Beryl Keep** - fortress-district, on a will surrounded by walls. 

**Tarn Ward** - Central ward, commerce district. Tarn Thoroughfare opens at moonrise, lit by the heavens and floating lanterns. Basic goods can be purchased at %200 their usual cost. However, of fine elven make. Weapons have +1 bonus to damage rolls, horses and mounts have increased movement by 10 feet, other items are beautiful & durable. All common magic items can easily be found here. Uncommon magic items have 50% chance of being found here.

**Feygrove** - nightly parties. (TCG p83)

**Reverie Walks** - Artistic & spiritual center of Ethelia. Labyrinth of living trees and stones. 

**Emerald Citadel** - Castle of faded whtie marble, covered with climbing ivy and sprouting plants. 

### Ethelvarden

30,000. Elven home turned forest train town over the past century. More Willowan than Ethelia, also home to many humans and halfings/Fey’Ri. Settled by elves after the Godswar, though populated by many races. 

Most diverse of the southern cities. Home to many half-elfs, outcasts from Ethelia, and southern merchants. 

Elven & Fey tendency for building into and around trees, with long, curving bridges that move throughout clustered quarters. Trees that are fantastical in their size, older than the Willowan Kingdom itself and likely seeded by the gods in the First Age. Willowan & Elven architecture exists in a collaged harmony with facades of gray and bluestone against the trees. 

In its time since the development of the reactor, ethereal lights activate the city with a lively glow at night. Not overpowering or polluting, the presence of Ether Technology subsumes the synergistic nature of urban life with the forests around it. 

Located at the convergence of the River Celebrant, the Heylelian River, and a pivotal anchor for the Kharreth Vel, Ethelvarden’s use of a traverse town long precedes its train station. If anything, the train station only made Ethelvarden more of what it already was - a portal in the south, connecting the Zan Realm to the Ethelian Realm, and a weave of all the cultures that passed through it. 

### Havens of the Aegis

Sprawl of settlements, keeps, and castles that have been home to multitudes of communities for centuries. Allegedly the domain of Helm himself during the Godswar, the Aegis has always been seen as a protected sanctuary, with many hidden and fortified citadels throughout its lands. 

### Misty Forests

Name in elven is ‘***Mista Faer,***’ directly translated to Common as Fey Forests - though throughout the second age became colloquially referred to as ‘Misty Forests,’ presumed by many commoners to be named for the fogs that roll down from the heights of the moor to shroud the trees.Though game animals roam in plenty, locals know well that the elves protect them and punish trespassers who poach in the forest. Even barbarians know better than to hunt here, as they don’t want to draw Melandrach’s attention or ire.

Travelers who leave the inhabitants of the Misty Forests alone, and who build their campfires small and solely of fallen branches, are usually permitted to pass, so long as the folk of the forest aren’t in a foul mood or stirred up against outsiders for some other reason. 

Made up of mostly giant oaks and maple, some of the most dense parts of the Ethelian Forests. Soil is rich enough to be almost black and is almost constantly moist. Produces a wide variety of undergrowth, travelling through can be difficult because of the density. Rich in animal species such as deer, dire wolves, elk, emerald constrictors, finches, manticores, owls, etc. 

As its name can suggest, the Misty Forests are shrouded in magic and mystery. Due to its dark, entangled nature, many Willowan settlers avoided construction and left the forest to the fey. It is, then, inherently closer to the Feywild than any other region throughout the Willowan continent. Feycrossing are abundant - tales and stories are rich, though as is warnings and cautions of adventurers losing their way and becoming myths themselves, or never seen again. All the still, much treasure, magic, and wonder is to be found. Ancient temples, Netherese ruins, pools of raw ether, and a winding network of caverns beneath the ground have attracted many adventurers. <br> 
	**Tombholds** - narrow cracks in the face of the escparpent that marks the [directional] edge of the [name] Hill, and extends [directio] halfway through the northern end of the Misty Forests. The score or so of cracks are barely wide enough for an armored human to walk into, though are the only known ground-level access into a network of caverns, and are the sites of hasty, ancient human burials: fallen adventurers were stuffed into them, fully dressed and with their belongings, which often included treasure - even magic items. Sages & legends suspect the Chosen of Mystra resupply the Tombholds with magic from time to time, because burials known to have been plundered have been discovered to hold magic by later searchers. The Tombholds are almost all claimed by forest beasts as lairs. <br> 
	**The Dead Glade** - small clearing in the wild heart of the Misty Forests (few agree on just where) in which some sort of ancient, fell magic holds sway. It can readily be recognized by the long-dead, falling-apart beholder that hangs in midair above it, reduced to an empty globe of sagging chitin plates and rotting fangs hanging askew; all of its eyestalks haave entirely rotted way. It’s not undead, but may serve as shelter for undead. If some adventurers’ tales can be believed, that is. And the magic that holds the remains of the beholder fixed in place makes the flesh of living creatures creep and crawl, and affects them in odd ways that vary from one being to another; some have gained darkvision, lasting years, or levitation or other abilities. Just what this magic is, and why it affects living creatures in different ways, are one of the Misty Forests’ many unexplained mysteries. 

### Mythfaer (City of Magic)

Primarily wood elf settlement, blending almost seamlessly into the forest around it.

Sweeping curves, soaring towers, structures built into the living trees. To many leves, the city is ar reminder of the ancient elven cities of old; some call it the Myth Ellesia of the East, even nowadays after the restoration and subsequent fall of that fabled city. Even where stone is used in construction, ivy and other living plants grow through, over, or around most structural elements, giving most of the city a green cast. 

Still, very much civilized. Schools of music and magic, a great library, bardic instruction, and temples or shrines to Melora/Silvanus, Tymora, Mystra, and Ioun. Knowledge is a treasure, as much as magic or wealth could ever be. Cobalt Reserve might be the greatest assembly of written knowledge anywhere in the world, but in the end, that represents accumulation for its own sake. Mythfaer is where study and wisdom are honored - if your charge is to translate an ancient tome in a lost language, to learn the proper intonation of a complex song, or to better understand the cryptic writings of a long-dead sage, there is no better place to seek aid than Mythfaer. <br> 
	Rarely is interaction with one so simple as to ask a question and be provided an answer. Learning to cast a particular spell, to find an ancient ruin, or understand a specific secret might involve undergoing months of instructions to prove to a teacher that the knowledge is being entrusted to a deserving patron. 

Given its beauty, a visit to Mythfaer is among the most memorable experiences most non-Ethelian might have. Even among those that regularly fight monsters or handle magic, Mythfaer is a place of quiet, contemplative beauty, splendid opportunities for learning, and respite from the harsher realities of the North. 

Local legends and reverent traditions often uphold the practice of passing across the River Sirion or the River Celebrant as an allegorical washing as one travels to or returns to Mythfaer. Rather than cross one of many bridges, practitioners often find ferry, raft, or even swim across either of the two rivers. 

City exists on two levels - with a few structures built on the ground around an ancient temple to an elven arcanist

Residences and city temples are built into the upper boughs of the forest - elves string rope bridges between these site and have circular walkways constructed around the trees, like a more elegant version of the ewok village on Endor combined with Yavin IV

Long led by a high mage. One of the longest ruling, and certainly the most influential, Alustriel, stepped down more than a hundred years ago. Replaced by Shevarash

Moonbridge - Magical Feycrossing - a bridge that forms in the moonlight over the lake and extends as far as the eye can see - a known Feycrossing

Lahrast’Alu - (Full Moon Lake) - Ethereal waters, also a sacred lake 

### Vault of Sages

The most famous library of the Ethelian Region, some consider it one of the greatest collections of knowledge in all of Willow, only rivaled by that of Myth Ellesia to the far west or the Cobalt Reserve. 

Original library of Ethelia was burned to the ground, rarest books were rescued and preserved by the Harpers. Alustriel Silverhand, an original Harper, constructed the library on the bank of Lahrast’Alu <br> 
	Lore required for construction of magical Helms and Robes of the Lords of willow was discovered by mage Aghairon within the vault (Dragonward Construction) <br> 
	A Selunite temple in the city joined with the Vault of Sages in a project to assist the Harpers in mapping the surrounding environments and Feywild.

Study and wisdom are honored, though held by a high esteem of a gatekeeper. One must prove themselves, or be willing to contribute hard earned coin and time. 

Originally located on the Northwest Bank of Lahrast’Alu, relocated down the magical stream towards the center of the city.

Initial questions will point any outsiders to the building that is now **[[Factions/The Map House\|The Map House]]**.

At five stories, one of the tallest buildings in the city - almost an omega-horseshoe as it extends up from two enormous, magically twisting oak trees and forms a bridge between them. 

First and second floors of each trunk are public galleries and lounges, called the Forehall. News from all over Willow is displayed on broad sheets hung on the walls. Multiple copies of popular reference works are found here in open book galleries including:

> [Dedblood’s Atlas of Willow](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Delblood%27s_Atlas_of_Faer%C3%BBn)
[Revendro’s Roll of the Passing Years](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Revendro%27s_Roll_of_the_Passing_Years) - [Roll of Years ~2,000 onward](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l4mDlNivTlJHnAm09DQNSjqejiR4cQwObY5zLSi8t0A/edit)
[Gaurdront’s Guide to Monstrous Beasts](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Volo%27s_Guide_to_Monsters_(in-universe))

Third through fifth floors are studies and offices, generally organized by topic. Offices are those of scribes, sages, bookbinder, etc employed by the Vault.

Five basement elves where the stacks are located. Only attendants, commander of the Spellguard, and the High Mage are allowed to access these levels. Bookshelves themselves are located in twisting passagesways that, while organized, are difficult to navigate without length training experience.

-Antoneus & friends
-Teleportation circle to Mithril Mantle
-Currently working with Steve & Levi to build flying ships using ethereal harnessing technology from the first age - could clean polluted ethereal air
### Trielta Hills

Rolling terrain, scattered with small settlements of gnomes and halflings, life seems pastoral and idyllic. Halfling farmers tend to their plots and gnome miners scrape out the interior of the hills seeking the bits of gold and silver they may find waiting there. No warlords threaten this land, no liches or dragons plot to seize it for themselves. Occasionally do offer some impressive bounty, gold rushes, treasure, etc. 

### Mythruar - City of Stars

### Lake Syolkir - Lake Wild Star (Meteor)

### Vel (Blade)

### Ath (End of)
Population 8,000 - 65% elven, 20% human, 15% other

Aptly named ‘End of,’ Ath is both the end of the Ethelian Forests and the end of the rolling Run Plains. It’s a city on the edge that, unlike Ethelvarden’s harmonious transitions, has been the focal point of many battles and campaigns in its history. Originally established by the Elves of Ethelia after the Godswar as an outpost to keep watch over the feuding Crown Wars, Ath became a territory that turned its ownership over many times until the Rage of Dragons, when Elves of Ethelia fortified its defenses with aid of the Willowan Kingdom and it was certified an Ethelian territory.

Now it stands as a trade post between Willow and Ethelia, and many day-to-day matters between teh alliance of cities are handled here within the Emerald Chambers - previously the outposts war room, now turned into the central citadel of the Emerald Enclave. 

Since the union between Willow and Ethelia, Ath is neutral ground, but its elven majority population and heavy Ethelian military presence occasionally makes non-elven citizens and diplomats uneasy. Ath is governed between two appointed captains, one by the Willowan Crown and the other by the Ethelian Wardens. 

The city itself does not have the walls that it used to, but rather ruins of many military buildings and structures make up numerous fortified tiers of land that arc around the city’s heart. Architecture of both Willowan and Elven make is present. Inthe century since the addition of a train station, Ath has become a common mid-point from travelers between regions and offers many inns, taverns, and night life. 

A collection of temples reside in repurposed structures, some notable shrines to Betrayer Gods and other deities are secreted away into its forested sides. Numerous merchant guilds run most businesses, but Zhentarim & rival gangs are real power behind guilds themselves. Many Zhentarim use Ath as an escape - a threshold that once crossed signifies the arrival of safety. 

### Kiir (Meteor)

### Honn (gnomish: heart)

### Nova Aros

### Kharreth Vel (Fey Blade)

### Evaliir (Song)

### [[Eos/Willow/Evergalea\|Evergalea]]

One of many small settlements hidden throughout the southwestern forests, this one in the Alder Draco Woods was home to dragonborn enclaves living in peace away from kingdom, utilizing the Karreth Vel for trade with Ethelvarden.**
