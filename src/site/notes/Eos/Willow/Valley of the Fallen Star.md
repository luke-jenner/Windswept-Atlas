## Campaign 1 Description:

*A canyon river valley that flows into the ocean - the Starfallen Sea. While the Gray Road itself veers eastward away from the crags and cliffed shoreline here, sets of side paths marked with a variety of signage descend downward closer to sea level. Some signs are in Willowan Common, clearly demarking the Valley of the Fallen Star or the Moonlit Run which it crosses over. Others are more obscure in a variety of languages.*

*Something else striking as you descend further, the heavily used path becomes lined with spaced-out spears, mounted upon each are skulls wearing helmets of the Willowan Crownsguard - clear warning signs to any descending from the Gray Road.*

*While the sounds coming from the valley grew louder, more raucous - at times musical though dissonant in harmony, as you turn around the spiraling slope and gain vision of the valley, the scene before you is a bit overwhelming.*

*Ancient ruins, similar to those you saw in the Serpent Hills, are scattered, crashed about the valley - landed on plateaus, some protruding from the waters of the Moonlit Run, and some wedged sturdily in-between the cliffs. Built into those ruins, and off of them and around them is a smal, bustling, lively city. Some of these additions are masonry in their own right, many are built from severed parts and cabins of full sailing ships. A number of these structures look to be built out of massive bones - either wales, or perhaps even larger creatures. One building is adorned with a massive skull, which, at first glance, looks unmistakable to be that of a dragon. The lights of many torches dot and illuminate the valley, some strung between buildings, others connected to rope bridges that web through the settlement. High above, tall structures seem to lean and rock with the wind. You even catch vision of humanoids riding bat-like wing contraptions made of bone and leather, flying in the winds above the valley.  Down below, a multitude of small rowboats are seen moving about, some making dock, others sailing westward into the Starfallen Sea. Lining the coast as well as amassing to create several small constructed islands are many wrecked ships out the mouth of the river.*

*The sounds, as I’ve remarked, are almost overwhelming. Not just your bardic fare of individuals and bands playing in the taverns throughout, but sounds of shouting are all to common, in soem cases the clatter of steel on steel as petty fights appear to be just part of the atmosphere. A gunshot catches your attention off in the distance as you see a halfing swinging on a rope some 120 feet away, taking pot shots with a Magaron pistol - similar to copy’s -  at a group of cloaked half-orcs that are cursing at him from a walkway.*

*Your arrival, though, even as diverse and colorful of a party as you are, goes unnoticed by the locale. While in larger Willowan cities, humans are a majority race with elves, dwarves, and halflings making up larger minorities, the races here seem to have no common majority. In front of you, a gnome riding on the shoulders of a pale white tiefling brandish shortswords and gives chase to a blue dragonborn across a bridge. An older half-elf walks arm-in-arm with a tabaxi, strolling out of a tavern built from the deck of a ship. A gnoll and a sylithian are engaged in an unarmed brawl as they’re being watched on and jeered at by a goliath with three kenku perched on his shoulders. A large cart passes by, wrapped in a mystical wind that looks to ward off any roguish hands, though even more peculiar is the air elemental - gaseous yet strikingly material - pulling the cart. A goblin, dressed in black robes far too big for himself, walks chest forward, nonchalantly surrounded by three animated skeletons adorned with chain armor and steel weaponry. A firbolg carrying backpacks that are altogether more volume than her own body is enticed in selling candles to a pair of drow - dark elves that are so rare in Willowan cities that many go their entire lives without ever meeting one.*
