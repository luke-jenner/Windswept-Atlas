Mros Mountains - Not yet snowy mountain range, houses reactor and Wilengate. Due to terrain and lack of wildlife higher up, not many villages exist and conditions are hard to live off the grid. 
### Mrost 
Northernmost city of Willoan Kingdom, snowy. ~70,000. Dwarven home in Willo. Fortress. 
### Mrosthon
Dwarven Castle City. ~20,000.

### Loudwater
**Small city, ~4,000 - Humans & Half-elves, some elves & halflings

Pleasant, thriving community where the Reykyr’s River splits - itself running westward into the Sunset Mountains while the Heylelian River runs east then south through the Wildwood and to Willow.

Picturesque garden town, every square patch of ground and any available surface adorned with lovingly tended greenery and full gardens and bowers to be found all over town. Wooden buildings - all shapes and sizes, no two of which are alike - overgrown with vines and decorated hanging plants, with plants both inside and on teh roof. Even the streets are planted with tanglemoss, wore down to bare dirt on busy routes. Streets curve and meander to provide a good view or an interesting route. Giant ancient trees line the green grassy banks on the river. Town has defensive walls, covered with planted flowers. Either melts back into the forest or has grown out of it. 

Life is slow here, for one that enjoys the view more than the hurry.

Bridge over the riverr, Loudwater spreads on all three sides of the split. Part flows over upthrusting rocks, giving the town its name. A wide pool was dug into the bank of the river, providing an area for lading cargo, serving as the harbor. Barges, coracles, and flat-bottomed skiffs used for fishing and trade cluster here. The only ugly things are those left for bare practicality - four warehouses by the harbor and  the mining beside them on the west.

Bridge is spectacular and beautiful arching stone structure - decorated with fanciful carved stone heads, with snarligng, pig-snouted face said to be those of dragon turtles. They watch over the warehouses, giving the business its name: The Watchful Turtle. (secure storage space)

Local temple of Lathander ministers majority of matters of faith in the city, at least for humans. Elves worship Mielikki & Silvanus. 

Zhentarim agents known to scout in Loudwater.
