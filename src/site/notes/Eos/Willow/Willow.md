Willo - Crown City. ~500,000. Walled. Inner City/Royal Grounds, seven main wards. (Castle Ward / Trades Ward / Dock Ward / Sea Ward / North Ward / South Ward / Field Ward) Currently protected/surrounded by Dragonward of Aghairon - magical dome shield that wards off dragons and other attackers, created by Archmage Aghairon at the beginning of the Second Age. Ruled by King Willow and Royal Family, along with Council of Masked Lords. Divided into districts, ruled by lesser magisters.

Castle Ward - Built around Mount Willow, **Parandor Keep** as its main castle complex. (named after first King & Open Lord of Willow) Houses military forces, courts, governments and Castle Market. 

North Ward - Home to nobles, peaceful, upperclass, mostly houses. Willowan Central Station. Cliffwatch.

[College of Ollam](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/New_Olamn) - Bardic College of Lore, historic, longstanding, holds an amphitheater

Trades Ward - Three times size of Castle Market, its own market town. Bustling day and night, shops, entertainment, theaters, the like. Lots of illegal shit, but high presence of City Watch.

College of Westeel - Bardic College of Valor, newer, infamous for more low-brow performances

Southern Ward - Middle class and slums. Home of Blackstaff Tower, Cobalt Reserve.

Dock Ward - Historically most dangerous, most of Willow’s slums, warehouses, etc.

House of Holyhands, central Aethriac Temple located in North Ward, converting many old temples to old deities into Aethraic Temples

Blackstaff Tower, located in South Ward, central mages guild and academy for arcanists. Currently absorbing Watchful Order, a dying guild of Mages and Arcanists initially built to protect the weaker, less magically skilled from the Fey Wild. Third age has lessened the need, many of the Watchful Order have converted to Aethraism.

Field Ward - Outside of city’s walls to the north/east, once a caravan yard, battlefield, muddy mess. Not patrolled by City Watch actively, though will intervene.

### Willow History
Walled city, on high plateau at apex of gulf on the west coast, split by Willowan River… Fabled once an Elven pire of Illefarn, dwarf prospector (Melair) discovered mithril beneath Mt Willow in the first age, struck an agreement to mine… Dwarves (Melairkin Clan) ruled below, elves ruled above. 

During Godswar, many Elves left to Ellesion. Some elves wanted to stay behind, but sitting emperor didn’t want to see another rule so used magic to raze the city before leaving. Many historians mark this as a threshold of the start of the Crownwars, the mortals arms’ race into the second age. Melairkin Clan dug into undermountian, never seen again…

Humans from east ‘discovered’ harbor empty, used as tradeoutpost for most of first age. During which, Halaster Blackcloak built his tower at the base of Mt Willow and ruled until he, like hte Melairkin, vanished under the mountain.

### Defenses

City Guard (not city watch) - staffed garrisons, road patrols, watch posts

Strong walls on landward sides, protected in party by Mount Willow on the seaward side. Mountain is studded with watch towers and defensive positions, patrolled by special guard units and flights of griffons. 

Large native population of adventuring classes (mages, priests, warriors) more than willing to deal with miscreants who threaten their home city

Eight Walking Statues, can be animated by the Blackstaff of Willow
