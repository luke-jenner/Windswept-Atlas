A bastion of civilization in the Ethereal Plane. Serves as a nexus of diplomacy and trade, a repository of histories and secrets, and a thriving sanctuary for those seeking safety or a better life. 

A miracle of architecture - a floating city carved out of a single, massive divine fossil known as **The Eternal Comet** that snakes around colossal gemstones.

An extraplanar refuge known for its collaborative society and ecological beauty - Heroes and paupers meet on equal footing in Halios. By common agreement, power and resources are equitably shared. Dignity is afforded to all, and great need is met with great aid. 

Lead Factions:
- **Voices of the Ancients** - leaders of Halios, descendents of Archon that never left Halios - hire freelancers to asess threats to Halios
- [[Factions/Horizon Guard\|Horizon Guard]] - seek information so they can identify crisis points across the planes

"The Cobalt Archon" - one of the founders of Halios from the ancient city of Archon. Known for that as he befriended a Cobalt Dragon that he traveled the planes with, assembling a mass of knowledge and treasure. 
	Name has since been lost.
	Known for philanthropy and protection - knowledge could build and protect us from chaos of the worlds. 
	Started the "Cobalt Reserve" in the city of [[Eos/Flying Cities of the First Age/Archon\|Archon]] itself, though was lost during the Fall of Flying Cities 
	The "[[Factions/Cobalt Soul\|Cobalt Soul]]" in Willow and Ellesion connect their heritage to the Cobalt Archon, valuing the pursuit of knowledge as a force of protection in the realms. They, however, made it religious following [[World Lore/The Godswar\|the Godswar]], attributing reverence to Ioun after her work in defeating the Betrayer Gods.
### Court of Whispers

Denizens of Court of Whispers barter for current knowledge. Heralds, criers, bards, and griots buy and sell information from the fifteen founding civilizations active in Halios, as well as other lands. Skilled scouts and spies can also be hired for short-term recon and long-term infiltration. Mixed indoor-outdoor space with quiet alcoves and open plazas. 

**Voices of the Ancients** - the leaders of Halios - employ freelancers from the Court of whispers to keep track of major concerns in their people’s homelands, as well as potential threats to Halios, while the Horizon Guard seek information so they can identify crisis points where their operatives are needed. Powerful organizations and individuals from across the planes send agents to the Court of Whispers to collect information and do business on their behalf. 

### House of Convalescence

Focuses the life-giving energies of the **Eternal Comet**, allowing for its incredible feats of healing magic. This makes the House of Convalescence an oasis for the sick, the injured, and the desperate. It draws clerics and healers of many traditions, most come to serve those in need, but some seek to understand the magical properties of the place itself. <br>

### Palace of Exile

First Age civilizations, escaping to the Ethereal Plane to flee from the Fall of Falling Cities, built the Palace of Exile as a place that would always help those in need. Predominantly populated during the Godswar over 2,000 years ago, the palace has spacious living quarters with adjoining gardens and recovery centers, where refugees are cared for physically, mentally, and emotionally as they make the transition to either living in Halios permanently or relocating to a new land. The Palaces’ staff coordinate with the House of Convalescence to provide the best possible aid to the sick and wounded. 

[[Factions/Horizon Guard\|Horizon Guard]], Halios’ dedicated search-and-rescue force, are headquartered at the Palace of Exile. 

Set higher that most buildings on the comet, Palace of Exile is built on a natural occuring rise in the comet's surface, with steep walls that need a walkway to ascend. The pathway is paved from an older style than most of the streets, they're carved from the comet itself and glow with your footsteps. 

The exterior facades are adorned with masonry that glows from absorbing the light of the comet on which are murals of constellations (not constellations of Eos, but of other planes - guide travelers to the heart of the comet, representing inerconnectedness of the cosmological wheel)

### Trade Discal

Encircling the Eternal Comet, Trade Discal is a massive marketplace designed so that the founding civilizations could trade on equitable terms. IT serves the needs of cities and nations or major trading companies, rather than individual sellers or producers, which is enforced by its high taxes and fees. Large quantities of goods, such as herds of animals or tons of metal ore, can be transported via the Cobalt Jewels to the Trad Discal quickly and safely. 

### Cobalt Jewels

Connect Halios to its founding civilizations. Ethereal teleportation. Requires a DC14 Arcana to use for Plane Shifting 

A raised discal, almost primal in its stonehenge-like consruction, though rather than a full circle it is half of a widened oval. Ancient, marble pillars that create arches along the arc almost look like gateways, fittingly underneath each are several crystals.

### Starlight Sanctuaries 

Perched atop the highest spires of Halios, the Starlight Sanctuaries are majestic structures that serve as both centers of cosmic study and sanctuaries of celestial wisdom. Observatories are dedicated to the unraveling ofo the mysteries of the multiverse, the tracking of celestial phenomena, and the interpretation of the cosmic tapestry that weaves through the Ethereal Plane. 

Crafted from ethereal rsytal of the comet, each observatory is an intricate fusion of art and magic, adorned with celestial engravings, luminescent glyphs, and floating starlight orbs. They stand tall, reaching toward the ethereal expanse, their crstyalline spires reflecting the ever-changing hues of the comet's tail. 

Powerful ethereal telescopes, crafted from crystallized starlight. Adorned with silver filigrees and embedded with sapphires that refract and enhance the light of distant stars. Seers and astronomers utilize these telescopes to peer into the far reaches of the Ethereal Plane and beyond.

(Myriad of diverse ships - some look ancient elven in make, others far from recognizable - some entirely of crystal, one of wispy fire.

Flashing motes of brunestone, as if creating a runway for the Moonspear, align themselves to form a path between the ship and the harbor.

Glistening mooring towers resonating with very visible, abjuration protection enchantments flag your passing into the harbor, before astral ropes dance out to secure the Moonspear.
