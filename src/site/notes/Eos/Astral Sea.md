### As Told by Steev, First Mate of the Phasmatis de Paxis

-Supposed to be in the background - like a backstage - it’s nowhere, it’s in-between everything 
-No one is SUPPOSED to go there

“Terms and concepts like space, distance, time, movement, body, and even plane itself are relative. They exist only as perceptions, not as reality. 

>"Take two thin stick and spread them about a foot apart. Then, move them within 6 inches of each other. Then half the distance of that. And then again. And then again. Until they almost touch. Then imagine half the space that separates the sticks. Again. And again. Imagine the space until it gets infinitely tiny.
The sticks will never actually touch, because they only cross half the distance - so on into infinity."

Between everything there is a space - sometimes a space that can only be imagined. 

The astral sea is not a place - it’s not a space at all - it’s a realm of the mind. It’s all a matter of perspective. 

"**The mind sees distance. Feels space around it, and perceives what it thinks is a plane. No matter where a body goes - they’re on a plane, right? Wrong. A person can leave the planes.** "

It’s not space travel because you’re in the void between space. 

Many have now used it as a means to get from one plane to another. 

If these planes - these worlds that we exist in - were created at some point, and they’re separate, then it’s safe to say no one was MEANT to go to the Astral Sea. The first mortal pioneers of the Astral Sea must have wound up there by arcane incident.   

It’s the backstage area that no one was ever meant to see. 

Dead gods, floating in the void. Historically, this is where the [[World Lore/Dawnwar\|DawnWar]] took place. 

Creatures don’t age or suffer from hunger or thirst. 


[[NPCs/Steev\|Steev]]: TIME DOES PASS ON THE ASTRAL PLANE, BUT INCREDIBLY SLOWLY. 365,000 to one. Or, 1,000 years on the Astral Plane is a single day here on the Prime Material. 

-Natural healing is useless - your wounds won’t close over time - can only heal through magic
-Resting doesn’t do anything - no spell recovery - but you still need to sleep for your mind
-Potions that have a time duration could last forever (170 days = 6 seconds)
-Potions become viscous (like ketchup) and get stuck to sides of vials - use wine skins instead

Time does catch up to you - as soon as you leave, every day you spend will be given right back. Diseases could catch up. Hunger catches up. 

**You need a conduit - a permanent link between worlds of mortals and worlds of the gods - a constructed connection that are formed to allow these existences to be together.** 

It’s how [[World Lore/Gods\|gods]] send spells past the Divine Gate. It’s how you pass to the Feywild or the Shadowfell. They’re typically invisible, most have some kind of a lifespan. Usually if it forms naturally, the conduit will swallow a moment of the plane it cracks to life on. Takes it with it. 

Those conduits are the only natural thing in the Astral Sea. These voids, light holes. 

The SAFEST way to travel there is through Astral Projection - just sending your consciousness there rather than your entire corporeal self. Attached via a mental cord. But, you cannot bring anything back with you.

Levi has detailed charts of the Astral Sea, navigation lines, and runes that move across each chart. Stolen long ago from a githyanki vessel. At one point had a magic spell attached that alerted its previous owners and they were attacked, followed them to githyanki shipyards where they were preparing an invasion of the Far Realm via a Codex of Infinite Planes, long story. 

Psychisch Wind - a storm of thought that battles travelers minds - made up of lost memories, FORGOTTEN IDEAS, minor musings, subconscious fears. First sensed as rapid darkening.
