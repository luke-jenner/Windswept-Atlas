Dar’Rag is a dwarven continent, builders hired by [[Factions/Magaron\|Magaron]] and [[Eos/Willow/Willow\|Willow]]an Kingdom. Still wealthy homeland, though travel as workforce to take home more wealth. Various dwarven communities are the heirs and survivors of Delzoun, the great Northkingdom of long ago. Despite continually warring over the centuries with orcs and goblinoids of the region, and having to fight off assaults from below by duergar and drow, the shield dwarves have stood fast, determined to hold the halls against all threats - and, when necessary, reclaim them.

Holds that survive from the days of Delzoun include Mithral Hall, Citadel Adbar, and Citadel Felbarr. Until recently, many of the dwarfolds were members of the Silver Marches, an alliance of cities that provided mutual protection across the North. Disagreements and failed obligations during a war with the orc kingdom of Many-Arrows destroyed the remaining rust of the Marches, and that pact is no more. The Dwarfolds still ally with one another, and individually with nearby human realms in Mrost, but no longer pledge to stand unified with their neighbors. 

To the east is a large sea, though history claims sophonts arrived on [[Eos/Willow/Willow\|Willow]] from the east.
