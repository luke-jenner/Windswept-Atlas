Ultima Thule books re: Amphrithios
	- Analyses of the mountain tower-homes of Amphrithios - archiectural wonders that rejected formerly-traditional ornamentation of the culture for sleek, clean towers that were intended to be open to their environment rather than trying to fight against it - it was not clean stone without decoration, it was pigmented to resemble the land around it
	- An biography of a painter turned soldier in The Ethereal Era, told through rhetorical readings of their paintings - Amphrithios was warring with [[Netharis\|Netharis]] in another swelling of a forever-war, clashing over the elite arcanist's desires for ethereal control - the painter is very eloquent in telling of the horrors of war, using the allegory of losing his hand in a magical skirmish as losing the ability to paint, and therefore losing his sense of self.
