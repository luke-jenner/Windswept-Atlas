- Also known as Highharvestide
- Dedicated primarily to The Raven Queen ([[World Lore/Gods/Gods\|Gods]])
- At the end of Elient, it is a time of transition, reflection, and endings
- Also honors Bahamut, Selune, and other deities of fate and death

### Overview
- Commemorates the Raven Queen's Ascension at the start of the Skliaic Period, where she took dominion over death and passage
- Symbolizes both the cycle of harvest and decay, and the journey of souls from life into the afterlife
- As year's harvest concludes, reverent mortals offer thanks for what has been gained and surrender what must now be released 
- A night when the veil is thinnest, when mortals remember that endings, too, are sacred beginings 

### Superstitions
- Never sleep with a mirror uncovered; the dead may look back
- A candle that burns blue is a soul at peace - if it burns green, they are watching. If it dies without smoke, they are calling you.
- if a stranger knocks thrice at midnight, do not answer - for it may be someone who never left
- The Veil is thinnest at midnight - spirits cross freely
- Never speak your full name after the eleventh bell - to name yourself beneath the Raven Queen's gaze is to invite her to weigh your fate before its time
- Leave an empty chair at the feast - the dead dine first. To sit in that place before the candles burn out is to steal a spirit's seat

### Observances/Traditions
- Feast of the Last Harvest - Before nightly celebrations begin, communities gather for a harvest feast celebrating the closing of the year's work - toasts are made not to gods, but to ancestors, lost loves, and lessons learned - it is said that the dead listen best when the living are laughing
- Twilight Vigils/Luminarias - At Dusk, processions light black and silver candles to guide wandering spirits - the faithful keep silent from dusk until the first light of dawn, symbolizing Raven Queen's own passage through death into sovereignty 
- Offerings of Memory - Written collections of the departed are burned, buried, or archived - releasing them to the beyond. Many believe dreams that night are touched by the dead, offering wisdom or closure 
- Silver Descent - In major cities such as [[Eos/Ellesion/Altrinios\|Altrinios]] and [[Eos/Ellesion/Emberhold\|Emberhold]], flocks of ravens and doves are released at midnight, their flight representing the souls' journey to the Raven Queen's domain
- Masks of Transition - Participants wear masks, taking on the guise of surreal or other-worldly creatures, embodying the tension between life's celebrationa nd mortality's inevitability 
- Parade of Masks - Parades through city streets, often regionalized as costumes, funeral garb, or masks 

### Regional Distinctions
- [[Eos/Ellesion/Néo Fanári\|Néo Fanári]] & [[Eos/Ellesion/Stormreach\|Stormreach]]
	- Harborfolk drop black stones into the sea for sailors lost that year. If the stone sinks, the soul has found rest. If it floats, they are still adrift.
	- Mechanical lights are dimmed or covered - only open flame is trusted, as artificed light "confuses the dead and draws their envy"
	- If you hear your name from the water, answer only once. The second call is never from the living. 
- [[Eos/Ellesion/Folos Forest\|Folos Forest]]
	- Masks are never removed until sunrise - Fey tricksters are said to w ander the roads, swapping faces with mortals who take theirs off too soon
	- Offer cream, honey, and sweets at crossroads stones - Fey children are said to wander at night
	- If the forest falls silent, hum softly - The Fey say music reminds the trees you are alive. The moment you stop, they might forget. 
- [[Eos/Ellesion/Altrinios\|Altrinios]] & Bigger Cities
	- [[World Lore/Astromancy\|Astromancy]] says the constellations shift ever so slightly during the Night of Ascension - the Mors Obitus dims, symbolizing mercy overriding order
	- Writing after midnight is tabbo in some academies - it's said the ink records whispers from the dead, and your letter swill spell their names when read backward
