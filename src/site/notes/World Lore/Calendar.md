## Year-Marking

*Year-marking calendars vary across the realms and kingdoms of Eos. Many regions and beliefs reference a significant event, charting years before and since that event. For example, the Willowan Kingdom declared 1 WR as the year the kingdom was reckoned from the Heartlands putting an end to the Crown Wars, which is 1,536 years prior to present day, meaning we are in 1537 WR. The city-state of Altrinios, built from the remnants of the Heraklean Empire after the Fall of Flying Cities, recognizes its constitution of democracy as 1 AE, placing us today in 2992 AE. If you ask a commoner the year, most are confused. If you ask a scholar the year, most are frustrated. Hence, many regional calendars assign names to particular years or time periods, such as The Year of Retreat (601 WR, the union of Ethelia with the Willowan Kingdom & the mass immigration of elves to Ellesion), The Year of Draconic Rage (2002 AE, the year in which dragons, chromatic and metallic alike, became suddenly violent upon mortal civilizations), or more recently The Crisis of Dragons (30 years ago today, the year in which the Cult of the Dragon successfully released Tiamat to the Material Plane, revealing breaks in the Divine Gate, and her subsequent defeat and return to Avernus.)

Most commonly, scholars working between continents and regions refer to an indisputable year - The Godswar. 992 AE and 666 PWR could all be referred to as 1 BR, the year of the Battle of Ravenstone. Or at least, the First Battle of Ravenstone. In common terms today, 1GR marks the end of the First Age - a time when mortals across Eos were no longer subject to the destinies of the divine or the oligarchies of the arcane, and when the world would once again raise new legends and stories. 

That places us today, 30 years since the Crisis of Dragons, in 2023 BR.*
