The stars of Eos are always shifting and changing. They can regularly be redrawn and re-understood - they are entirely contingent on narratives that are told. 

Mostly named in Celestial.

Real power of stars & constellations is on the Ethereal Plane - parallel with the Material Plane, though on another frequency.

Many sources of magic and spellwork have origins in tracing and charting constellations and garnering power from their coalescence, originating from [[World Lore/Astromancy\|Astromancy]]. 

Constellations shift - gain new names, new stories, new myths as they’re re-charted - some stay a long time, others are fleeting.
