### Once, [[the Lattice of Heaven\|the Lattice of Heaven]]
- In the Dawn Age, a grand structure of worlds & planes drawn by the [[World Lore/Gods\|Gods]]
- A specific web of connections - the stars themselves - to design and direct the flow of the Ethereal Weave
- A bastion complex in the middle of the [[Eos/Astral Sea\|Astral Sea]]
- Destroyed by the Titans ([[World Lore/Primordials/Primordials\|Primordials]]), who resented the Gods
- Fractured during the [[World Lore/Dawnwar\|Dawnwar]]
- REbuilt by the Gods into countless planar islands in the [[Eos/Astral Sea\|Astral Sea]]
	- Some maintained connections and orbital pulls of one another
	- Some fractured into one another, creating several layers of one concretion
	- Some rebuilt brdiges, others built their own walls with specific doors of communion
### Post-Godswar
- After [[World Lore/The Godswar\|The Godswar]], the Divine Gate was constructed to wall off the Material Planes from direct contact by the Outer Planes
- [[World Lore/Gods\|Gods]] and Powers reside in layers of concretion planes, known as the Outer Planes.
