Origins of magic - spells as [[World Lore/Constellations\|Constellations]] of stars in the weave 
	An ancient form of spellwork - maybe the first - certainly a predecessor to divination and dunamancy. Using movements of the stars to tell the future, but also to summon power of cosmic winds to attack enemies or protect loved ones. <br> 
	Spells are powered by particular constellations, sometimes only achievable at certain times of the year or entirely regional based on the hemisphere’s sky<br> 
	Many spells are the name of a constellation - the drawing of its components

Antikythera can be used to predict celestial phenomena, such as eclipses, moon phases 
-needs to be calibrated for specific location

### Power of Stars 

Real power of stars & constellations is on the Ethereal Plane - parallel with the Material Plane, though on another frequency.
	Stars are projections of the Ethereal Plane, “Realmspace” or “Etherspace” - parallel and contingent with the Astral Sea.<br> 
	Stars are spirits - concretions of ether - projecting themselves. When they are visible, spirits can communicate via starlight.

Many sources of magic and spellwork have origins in tracing and charting constellations and garnering power from their coalescence.

Constellations shift - gain new names, new stories, new myths as they’re re-charted - some stay a long time, others are fleeting
	Desire to name constellations: mapping the poetics of their relation
	-to make sense of the sky
	-to make it an object to which we can relate
	-to make it an object to which we can use
	Names are a barrier between us and what something is, but that thing can shift underneath its name - is the name still accurate?

### Tarot & Astrology

An ancient practice of Astromancy - potentially the first spell scrolls - transcribing constellations into images imbued with meaning and potential - allow a reader to derive narrative of their symbols. Many different decks exist, using different stars and different constellations. 
  
Astrology - uses constellation narratives as allegory for describing identities of individuals born under particular constellations.
