**Amaunator** - LG - God of the Sun/Time/Life, lord of heavens - Golden Sun solar deity of order, the sun, law, and time. He is viewed as a harsh but fair deity, revered by many rulers, soldiers, and powerful wizards. 

**Pelor**, the Dawnfather - NG - God of Agriculture and Growth

**Lathander** - NG - God of Dawn and Renewal
**Asmodeus** - LE, Hells, God of Trickery and Knowledge, Three inverted triangles 
	god of sin and indulgence. An ever ambitious and careful creature, Asmodeus retains his position all through the Reckoning of Hell, unlike many of the other archdevils. Asmodeus is the undisputed master of the Nine Hells, commanding fear and respect from all those who occupied his realm. He works on a grand scale, carefully constructing insidious and inexplicable intrigues, maneuvering the forces of wickedness like chess pieces on a board that encompasses all the planes. Asmodeus is depicted as the strongest, most cunning, and most handsome of all devils. Usually he appears as a handsome, dangerous thirteen-foot-tall human with lustrous skin and black hair, his crimson eyes shining with infernal power, his forehead crowned by a pair of small, sharp horns. 

**Bhaal** - NE, God of Murder / Death - Skull surrounded by ring of blood droplets
**Bane** - LE, God of Tyranny/War
**Cyric** - CE - God of lies

**The Raven Queen** - N - Goddess of Death, Fate, & Doom
	The name of the god of death is long forgotten, but she is called the Raven Queen. She is the spinner of fate and the patron of winter. She marks the end of each mortal life, and mourners call upon her during funeral rites, in the hope that she will guard the departed from the curse of undeath. She expects her followers to abide by these commandments:
		*Hold no pity for those who suffer and die, for death is the natural end of life.
		Bring down the proud who try to cast off the chains of fate. As the instrument of the Raven Queen, you must punish hubris where you find it.
		Watch for the cults of Orcus and stamp them out whenever they arise. The Demon Prince of the Undead seeks to claim the Raven Queen's throne.

**Seluné** - CG - Goddess of the Moon - pair of eyes surrounded by seven stars
	Together with her sister Shar, Selune created the night sky from the cosmic ether and blessed the twin worlds with life. She has infused her spirit into the moon and forever looks down on the world she helped create. Selune's influence on Eos is felt in the ebb and flow of the tides and in the comforting silver glow of a moonlit night. She brings light to darkness, holding back the tide of evil embodied by her shadowy sister. Mostly female, the Seunite priests known as silverstars administer to their flocks with patience and compassion, letting all know that "anywhere the full moon shines is the place for Selune." Silverstars are particularly interested in combating the dark side of lycanthropy. They wander Eos in search of werecreatures, hoping to aid them in maintaining or regaining control, or destroying those who have allowed their humanity to be overwhelmed by their affliction.<br> 
	*Let all on whom my light falls be welcome if they desire to be so. As the silver moon waxes and wanes, so too does all life.
	Trust in my radiance, and know that all love alive under my light shall know my blessing. Turn to the moon, and I will be your true guide.*
