*Written in Elvish, illustrated with silver ink of the Myth-Sayers of Eilistraee*

*Deep within the shadowed, labyrinthine depths of the Underdark, where the darkness conceals untold mysteries and horrors, there exists a folktale as old as the very stones that form the subterranean realm.*

In the time before time, when the Underdark was young and uncharted, a colossal leviathan - spawn of the primordials - roamed its winding tunnels and caverns. The monstrous entity was older than the Gods of Eos, if not a younger sibling to the earth itself - a living embodiment of the darkest depths. 

The Gaiaphage was said to be a being born of pure malevolence, an affront to the god Torog who ruled over the subterranean realms. It was a creature of endless hunger, its enormous maw capable of swallowing entire underground cities, and its insatiable appetite for destruction threatened to consume the entirety of the Underdark. 

Torog, the god of imprisonment and suffering, saw the Gaiaphage as a direct challenge to his dominion. In a titanic battle that shook the very foundations of the Underdark, Torog and the Gaiaphage clashed in a cataclysmic struggle. It was a conflict of godly portions, with the cavernous lair serving as the battlefield. The battle raged on for centuries, the earth itself contorting and twisting under the immense power unleashed by these cosmic forces. In what was hoped to be the end, Torog imprisoned the Gaiaphage in the deepest, most remote crevice of the Underdark - a tunnel carved from rivers of Torog’s own blood. There, the Gaiaphage was bound with chains of unbreakable stone, and powerful wards were placed to seal its terrible hunger for all eternity. 

The Prison of the Gaiaphage is a cathedral of dark beauty and nightmarish horrors (illustrated in drow gothic fashion). Jagged, obsidian spires rise from teh ground, like petrified tendrils of some ancient, eldtritch horror. The walls are encruste with pulsating, bioluminisecne that cast eerie, shifting shadows revealing countless carvings - crude runes and wards carved into the stone. 

In the heart of this dread cathedral, an immense chamber reveals the source of its legend. Here, a great, winding river of thick, black liquid flows eternally. This is the divine blodo of Torog, a substance darker and more malevolent than any earthly material. It courses through the chamber, manifesting the god’s dominion over imprisonment and suffering. Chains of gleaming obsidiean hang from the ceiling, descending into the inky river, binding its malevolence.

At the center of the chamber, a colossal, twisted statue of Torog stands sentinel. Its grotesque form appears to writhe in agony, and its empty eye sockets seem to watch those who dare enter. Before the statue is a pit - a seemingly bottomless void, said to lead to the darkest depths of the Undeark.

*To find the blood that binds the beast,
Seek the abyss and face the priest.
Seven chains, the key decrees,
Unlock the door to endless seas.*
	Next to “seek the abyss” is a quick sketch - a drawing of a pit, a bottomless void in a magical ink that moves upon the page - looking identical to the illustration of the pit <br> 
	On the back of the page is a handdrawn map - seven infinity-sign links are drawn over it - the map is a massive scale of the Underdark - one of the chains is drawn where Zanzarite exists today <br> 
	Seek the abyss/face the priest - at the bottom of hte void, a powerful guardian/demon Out of the Abyss, sworn to Torog’s service, now unbound after his death

  Now, the memory of the Gaiaphage has faded into myth. It has become a cautionary tale, a symbol of the price of hubris and insatiable nature of darkness. It is a parable, teaching the denizens of the Underdark to respect the god’s dominion and fear the consequence of challenging the authority of the Imprisoner. 

[Written more than two millennia ago - before the Godswar, before Torog’s defeat at the hands of the Dawnfather.
