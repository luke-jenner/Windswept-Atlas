## The End of the First Age
From the Journals of Leola, Historian and Wayfarer of Eos

Various historical records of today estimate the First Age to have lasted nearly 25,000 years (a handful of divine scholars claim it was less than 10,000, though their research is a bit more favorable towards the [[World Lore/Gods\|Gods]] as creators.) A rather loose term for any ancient history, the First Age is anything in between the [[World Lore/Dawnwar\|Dawnwar]] (27,000 PBR) and [[World Lore/The Godswar\|the Godswar]] (1 BR). 

Chronicling the end of the First Age is a scholarly debate due to the lasting mysteries of the causes for the Godswar. Necessary conflicts in the grander scheme to consider are the Rise and Fall of Flying Cities. In approximately 4000-3500 PBR, arcanist-led civilizations across Eos rose into the skies, harnessing the natural ethereal atmosphere of the weave to power their empires. Many histories indicate these civilizations were aided in their ambitions by direct contact with the gods as well as congrea=gations of primal druidic circles. Of these, **[[Netharis\|Netharis]]**, **[[Eos/Flying Cities of the First Age/Archon\|Archon]]**, **[[Eos/Flying Cities of the First Age/Amphrithios\|Amphrithios]]**, **[[Veskos\|Veskos]]**, and **[[Willo\|Willo]]** were dominant powers as either empires or flying nation-states. In the Ethereal Era, the millenia period between 4000 BPR and 1066 PBR, these airborne mortal civilizations warred over arcane knowledge - spreading themselves and their ambitions across the cosmological planes while engaging in territorial conflicts on the Material Plane, sometimes referred to as [[The Arcane Wars\|The Arcane Wars]]. 

In 1066 PBR, due to what is likely many causes that will continue to be studied for generations, the flying cities fell. Many scholars have proposed theses on oversight of arcane destabilization of the cities, some proclaim divine intervention and that the [[World Lore/Gods\|Gods]] usurped the mortal races that were greedy for the power of the gods, some even go as to suggest the Flying Cities awoke powers of the long-dormant Primordials, unready to harness them.  Due to a multitude of factors, the Flying Cities were destabilized and crashed down to the surface across Eos, beginning the Era of Upheaval.
	To keep an accurate chronicle that is not biased on the perspectives of the ancestors of those Flying Cities, I would cite a number of histories regarding prospering civilizations on the surface of Eos during the Ethereal Era. These civilizations, independent of the Flying Cities though often involuntary subject to their arcane endeavors, faced their own adversities and their own prosperities. Primalborn cultures across what is now [[Eos/Ellesion/Ellesion\|Ellesion]] and [[Eos/Kawluurac/Kawluurac\|Kawluurac]] were vibrant, developed peoples - many still such as cultures within the Hetos-Run, the Vandora Wilds, or the [[Eos/Kawluurac/Veldexian Reach\|Veldexian Reach]]. As an ancestor of [[Willo\|Willo]] and someone who was raised in the academies of [[Eos/Willow/Ethelia\|Ethelia]], my own research is positioned on the ancestry of the Flying Cities. My very verbiage may one day be seen as a product of its time period and fallacious due to my lack of global knowledge.

The cataclysmic fall of flying empires forever changed the surface of Eos - shifting the very arcane nature of the weave and changing the landscape. Arcane ley lines were twisted and sundered, sending even more smaller motes of earth into the sky, a symbolic mirror of the chaos that would transpire in the proceeding millenia. During the Era of Upheaval, now written as between 1066 PBR and 1BR, many of the survivors and remnant arcane communities of the Flying Cities began a feudal period of chaos. As an example of such, the Heraklean Empire - led by Heraklos, a powerful arcanist from [[Eos/Flying Cities of the First Age/Amphrithios\|Amphrithios]] - garnered mass support across northern [[Eos/Ellesion/Ellesion\|Ellesion]] as a proclaimed heir to the Amphrithioan Empire, forming a tyrannical empire that would last until Heraklos’ defeat and murder in 992 PBR. The resulting civilization was today’s city-state of [[Eos/Ellesion/Altrinios\|Altrinios]], which despite its own strife and conflicts over the last two millennia, remains one of the oldest cities lasting from the First Age. 

Now that I’ve painted a bit of a picture on what the Era of Upheaval would look like after the Fall, let’s discuss what we know about upheaval within ranks of the divine pantheons in the millenia before they would war with each other. Many of these events are still shrouded in mystery and obscured further by varying accounts of organized faith communities today, so I am merely stitching together lore from firsthand accounts to propose a factual history. 

Many civilizations and leaders during the Era of Upheaval sought guidance of the gods, seeing the Fall as divine consequence for the hubris of mortals. Taking on divine oaths and purposes, the spread of arts and culture was a flash flood of color into the new millennium, oftentimes built and disseminated by imperial conquest. Stories of the avatars of gods making appearances grows in frequency, as does their occasional conflict, however inconsequential in the global scale. Many of our accounts of gods and their antics come from this period.

- Sometime in the 3rd Century PBR, an individual is storied to have awoken as an Oracle, privy to her own generations of reincarnation, and through mysterious rite, she ascends to godhood 
- Taking on the mantle of the Goddess of Fate and Passage, she and her followers 
- The Ascension of the Raven Queen likely sparks existential urgency of the Gods - stories of their more mortal-like antics and interventions grow in frequency 
	- Play and trickery of mortals, even the seduction of mortals, are common myths
	- Demigods and heroes come into global mythology, potential half-gods
	- Stories of gods negligence and even spite and malice against mortals increases 
	- ((The Era of Greek Mythology-eque gods - divine, though now foolishly fallible))
- Growing piety of the mortals increases stories of boons granted by gods, offsetting power balances between mortal civilizations

Zralin Kiramaj of the [[Factions/Watchful Order of Magists & Protectors\|Watchful Order of Magists & Protectors]], has provided me with his own written timeline of divine conflicts during [[World Lore/The Godswar\|The Godswar]]. It is incomplete as it only notes particular events and leaves accounts of other gods and their champions entirely out. I’ve transcribed it here.

- Through uncertain causes, gods are forced into avatar forms, walking the Prime Material Plane of Eos as Mortals
- Some gods raced for latent primordial powers underneath Gaia Seeds (? - Zralin did not confide to me what this meant before his passing - I have speculations), others took a stance to defend them, possibly causing first tensions and & strikes.
- Continent of ________ (south of Willow) shattered and sunken in first divine calamity, combatants unknown - perhaps lost to history?
- Lolth of the Underdark begins to curse parts of the Folos Forest in Ellesion, before being struck down by Kord the Stormlord, forcing Lolth to the Abyss. The first known casualty of the Godswar, inciting alliances
- Armies of Lolth fled into the Hetos-Run, united with armies of Grumsh to begin conquest of Ellesion (maybe the first alliance of the Godswar) - fought against Corellon in what is now Ourihowl Canyon (ripped a planar rift from Mechanus)
- Torog begins tunneling under Dar’Rag, followed by Grumsh, who begins wreaking havoc on the mortal dwarfholds of Moradin
- Led by Asmodeus, many gods convened under the belief that they should rightfully inherit the Prime Material Plane, directly opposing Pelor & Melora’s belief that they should protect it while “relighting” their divinity
	- Asmoedus’ Legion is sometimes referred to as the Betrayer Gods
	- Asmodeus builds Valinor, a fiery stronghold-city on a volcanic island in the Starfallen Sea
- Melora defeats Bane and his goblinkin in the Thayan Fields, a once woodland plateau at the base of the Crystal Peaks, freeing his goblinoid legions and scattering his army across the region.
	- The battle leaves the plateau ashen, no longer able to support plant life
- Mortal champions of the gods arise to fight the legion known as the Betrayer Gods
- Zehir, tricked by Tharizdun, seeks to form a pact with demons - is forced into Tytherion by Xen'Drik, sewing seeds for the Age of Demons
- Pelor & Lathander draw Torog above ground, defeat him, and banish him to a portion of the Far Realm that borders the Underdark
	- Torog’s tears burned tunnels underneath Eos, his followers fled into them
	- Moradin & his followers build the King’s Cage as a secret trap for Torog for his return
	- Kord creates the Stormlord Heart, allowing his champions to enter Lolth’s home in the abyss - hides it in case the Dominion Deities were defeated 
- Battle of Ravenstone - final battle against the Betrayer Gods, ultimately razing Valinor and sundering the islands
- Resolution is obscured - stories of Moradin crafting divine trammels to seal gods away, gods questioning the original seeds of chaos of their descent, and Bahamut suggesting the creation of a Divine Gate 
- The Raven Queen ushers the Gods passage from the Material Plane through the Divine Gate
