*Adapted from the Dawnwar of the Forgotten Realms and the Gigantomachy in Greek Mythology.*

In written histories, the event marking the end of the Dawn Era and the beginning of the First Age. Estimated ~27,000 P.B.R.

A war fought between the [[World Lore/Gods\|Gods]] and the [[World Lore/Primordials/Primordials\|Primordials]] for dominion over all of ethereal existence. Said to have taken place in the [[Eos/Astral Sea\|Astral Sea]]. 

Incited by the Primordials after shattering the [[World Lore/Lattice of Heaven\|Lattice of Heaven]], creating what is now the [[World Lore/Cosmological Wheel\|Cosmological Wheel]]. 

Primordials released Primordial Chaos, resulting in the manifestation of the King of Terror and Queen of Chaos, entities of pure power.

Story of the Dawnwar is most commonly depicted and told through fresco murals from the First Age:
- At the bottom - Tharizdun, the Mad God, in chains in The Abyss 
- Shar & Selun√© defending the gates of the Material Planes
- Battle of the Dragon-God Io against the King of Terror primordial, giving birth to Bahamut and Tiamat, who cooperated to defeat the King of Terror and creating the first Dragonborn
- The Arrival of the Vaati - the Wind Dukes of Aaqa - armed with the Rod of Law from Amaunator - at the final battle to slay the Queen of Chaos and scatter the armies of chaos, paving way for Amaunator to create the horizon, ending the Dawn Age and starting the Days of Thunder.
